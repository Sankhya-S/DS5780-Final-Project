# Semantic Similarity within Hip-Hop, Folk, and Jazz Song Lyrics

## About the Project

In this repository, you will find the dataset and code used in the study examining semantic similarity within song lyrics across three distinct musical genresâ€”Hip-Hop, Jazz, and Folk. The purpose of this study is to uncover patterns of word usage and linguistic cohesion using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to quantitatively measure the semantic similarity of words within songs.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of lyrics from songs across multiple covering a span from 1970 to 2016. The songs were sourced from a public compilation designed for genre classification.

## Tools Utilized

* spaCy NLP Library
* spaCy 'en_core_web_lg' Model
* Pandas for data manipulation

## Findings

The study revealed distinct patterns of semantic similarity within lyrics of songs from each genre. Hip-Hop was observed to have a lower mean semantic similarity, suggesting a diversity in vocabulary as opposed to the higher similarity observed in Jazz and Folk.

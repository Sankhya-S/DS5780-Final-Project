# Semantic Similarity within Hip-Hop, Folk, and Jazz Song Lyrics

## About the Project

This repository contains the dataset and code for a study aimed at exploring semantic similarity in song lyrics within three musical genres: Hip-Hop, Jazz, and Folk. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the research quantifies and compares how closely words in lyrics within these genres are related in meaning, providing insights into the linguistic characteristics defining each genre.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized in this analysis merges lyrics from four distinct sources, including 'Sparktech's 2018 Textract Hackathon', '150K Lyrics Labeled with Spotify Valence,' 'Dataset Lyrics Musix,' and 'AZLyrics Song Lyrics'.

Spanning from 1970 to 2016, the collection encompasses various genres. The focus is on Folk, Hip-Hop, and Jazz for this study. By combining the 'test' dataset and the English songs from the 'train' dataset, and sampling 400 songs per genre, the analysis achieves a balanced comparison. The study centers on the 'Genre' and 'Lyrics' columns to ascertain semantic similarity across genres.

## Purpose of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to understand the patterns of vocabulary diversity within song lyrics and to measure the semantic cohesion found in lyrics across different genres. The study examines the hypothesis that Hip-Hop lyrics demonstrate lower semantic similarity compared to Jazz and Folk lyrics.

## Findings

The study revealed distinct patterns of semantic similarity within lyrics of songs from each genre. Hip-Hop was observed to have a lower mean semantic similarity, suggesting a diversity in vocabulary as opposed to the higher similarity observed in Jazz and Folk.

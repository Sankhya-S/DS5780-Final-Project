0,dear mama,2pac,Hip-Hop,"you are appreciated when i was young me and my mama had beef seventeen years old kicked out on the streets though back at the time, i never thought i'd see her face ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place suspended from school, and scared to go home, i was a fool with the big boys, breaking all the rules i shed tears with my baby sister over the years we was poorer than the other little kids and even though we had different daddy's, the same drama when things went wrong we'd blame mama i reminisce on the stress i caused, it was hell hugging on my mama from a jail cell and who'd think in elementary? hey! i see the penitentiary, one day and running from the police, that's right mama catch me, put a whooping to my backside and even as a crack fiend, mama you always was a black queen, mama i finally understand for a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man you always was committed a poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it there's no way i can pay you back but the plan is to show you that i understand you are appreciated lady don't ya know we love ya? sweet lady dear mama place no one above ya, sweet lady you are appreciated don't ya know we love ya? now ain't nobody tell us it was fair no love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there he passed away and i didn't cry, cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger they say i'm wrong and i'm heartless, but all along i was looking for a father he was gone i hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs they showed a young brother love i moved out and started really hanging i needed money of my own so i started slanging i ain't guilty cause, even though i sell rocks it feels good putting money in your mailbox i love paying rent when the rent's due i hope ya got the diamond necklace that i sent to you 'cause when i was low you was there for me and never left me alone because you cared for me and i could see you coming home after work late you're in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate ya just working with the scraps you was given and mama made miracles every thanksgiving but now the road got rough, you're alone you're trying to raise two bad kids on your own and there's no way i can pay you back but my plan is to show you that i understand you are appreciated lady don't ya know we love ya? sweet lady and dear mama place no one above ya, sweet lady you are appreciated don't ya know we love ya? pour out some liquor and i reminisce, cause through the drama i can always depend on my mama and when it seems that i'm hopeless you say the words that can get me back in focus when i was sick as a little kid to keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did and all my childhood memories are full of all the sweet things you did for me and even though i act crazy i gotta thank the lord that you made me there are no words that can express how i feel you never kept a secret, always stayed real and i appreciate, how you raised me and all the extra love that you gave me i wish i could take the pain away if you can make it through the night there's a brighter day everything will be alright if ya hold on it's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on and there's no way i can pay you back but my plan is to show you that i understand you are appreciated lady don't ya know we love ya? sweet lady and dear mama place no one above ya, sweet lady you are appreciated don't ya know we love ya? sweet lady and dear mama dear mama lady, lady, lady"
1,if-i-die-tonight,bun-b,Hip-Hop,"[chorus: x2 lyfe jennings]
if a nigga die tonight
make sure i didn't die in vain, and they feel my pain
make sure my niggas ride for me
or comin' up on the side of me, side of me
[bun b]
man i'm a real trill nigga (nigga) i been out on them blocks
with them hustlers (hustlers) them dealers (dealers) and killers sellin rocks
put in work in round the clock from when the sun went down
till it came back up and night came back around (around)
i did a lot of shit them late nights for the dough
robbin niggaz on the low (low) laughed at 'em then i go (go)
sometimes it went smooth and nobody got hurt
and sometimes i had to leave a nigga's dick up in the dirt
i ain't proud of what i did and if i could go back in time (time)
i'd try to find another way instead of packin' nines
totin k's and holdin' macs (macs)
but we know time ain't rollin' back
and hungry hyenas, they ain't foldin' jack
so on these cold and black streets, wolves keep huntin'
and a young black man can lose his life over nothin'
if i gotta go, please let it be for somethin' real
cause this bullshit hood shit is gettin' niggas killed on the real
[chorus: x2]
[bun b]
well if a deal goes dirty or the counts don't match (match)
or if i catch a motherfucker dippin' in the back (dippin' in the back)
say if a nigga disrespect me or my fam
and we take it to the streets and let the guns go blam
i don't really give a damn (damn) or really know whatever's gon' come (come)
and i'm a represent where i'm from (represent where i'm from)
man i don't wanna die (die) but i ain't scared to (i ain't scared to)
shit i just wanna make sure that i'm prepared to (i'm prepared to)
can't leave without a couple tickets in the stands
so my wife, and my momma and my children got cans (children got cans)
cause once i'm gone who goin' take care of my kids? (take care of my kids)
and do the same things for 'em that i did
man i'd rather do a bid (bid)
at the least they can see me behind the glass (glass)
instead i'm reminiscin' bout the past (about the past)
nigga don't know what he got, until he passes on
so let him tell 'em that he love 'em 'fore his ass is gone
[chorus: x2]
[young buck]
we trappin' hard right across from the graveyard
i just pray to god i don't have to work a day job
niggas gettin' robbed so i'm ridin' with my a-r

like if you ain't from around here, you was gettin' hit (c'mon)
send a o.g. some flicks, make they time go by quick (hey)
you surprised what some pictures in the penitentiary did (yeah)
we survived but most of us die for some bullshit
go to church but the devil's standin' on the pulpit (damn)
niggas lied just to kick it (what) swear to god they got a meal ticket
then they call you and they bout to get evicted (i know)
a underground king, i've been one ever since i was sixteen (c'mon)
pimp and bun'll tell you just what buck mean (what's up)

41,dead-pan,aesop-rock,Hip-Hop,"this be the dawning of the age of dead water
stitchin every b-boy fragment
somebody live enough to bust through the belly with a fist up
this is a right now generation murdered by the fan base
this is adored by the writers-dead water
with a still force activated
no i'm not feelin alright
formed by the village of badness and bad karma
punched by the stagnant water gate threw the fickle back
but by the window's still three nickels in a piggy bank
caught her with her head up funny stomach from the hunger pains
flashed automatic b-boy with big visions
in a matchbox apartment adjacent a crooked starship
who better nation a million's the only remedy
nine dizzy planets with a bullet riding centerpiece
take me through the gates
i'm bout as sick of burning find the hottest slacker in a visionary costume
con artist kamikaze conduct
warm for a second to the minute he whored herself to disaster
i recognize the cankers by the mechanical stagger
as opposed to the skip of big brother bad slapper
theologies who need to keep the cookies caffeinated
like a mad hatter that'll sleep now, ask after
calibrate the happy scale when he's soakin
wet with a mouthful of dead ideas and see if it tipped zero
stripped ego, tall stories of broad glory
i'll be god while you're still living life on a full 40
or maybe i'll be gramacin, homes poor, broke and lonely
hidden by my billygoat beard and cardboard monstrosity
i drink a bad glass of gumption
not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning disgusting
wildchild activater activate sludge enough to dungeon for a accolade and wild ones
i committed wild murder, went through the city
with a wild merger, woke up in a wildstyle burner
space case, boom box, hate tapes, no lemonade breaks (sweat), no cheddar in labor days
right now, im here to break a point of big system plus my screen
i was never cursed in a russmeyer bixon
spit sob stories to confront my dick addictions
of the dirty basement at the graves of salem witches
driving my stake through the face of painstaking business (checkmate)
but i scream misery (better breath take)
out of sleep, lifted up lobotomy, little jackie paper
and a magic dragon sack of dirty shrubbery
i'll be the ugliest version of paranoia
kingpin set in motion by the secondhand pressure
some get excited when the sun folds under
some get excited when the summer hits the pavement
some get excited when the bullet hits bone and a board
i'll escape through the train yard and sleep till it's broken
[same old]
this be the settling of debt of warm water
a mobile b-boy function
somebody mad enough to cut apart the curtain with a fist up
this is the dagger in the 88 magnificent memorial
this is the heater to a movement-dead water

no i'm not feelin alright"

54,ya-slippin,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"now what you just heard, people, was a little kickin
but let me tell you this while the clock is still tickin
this is the warning, known as the caution:
do not attempt to dis, cause you'll soften
just like a pillow, or better yet a mattress
you can't match this style or attack this
while i'm telling you, write on schedule
fuck with k-r-s and i'll bury you
deep in the dirt, or sand with a shovel
no fight, no scurry, or scuffle, just muffle
total domination on stage
kris is the name, 22 is the age
those that wanna battle, i know who you are
you got a little girl, you drive a little car
you come into the place with that look on your face
before you ran the mile, you lost the race
so assume you're doomed when you step in the room
i'll be the witch and you'll be the broom
i'll ride you, guide you into the concrete
i'll slide you to a funky beat
so what do we have here?
a sucka in fear
i snatched your heart
put it way up on the chart
at ten you're fucked
at nine you suck
at eight you're a sucker
at seven-a mothafucka
at six you're slapped
at five you're just wacked
at four you're lost
at three, you're just soft
at two you're an ass
at one, you're a dick
but before you slip, i'll whip
cuz homeboy, ya slippin'
i understand that music calms the savage beast
but keep in mind that i compose my music piece by piece
first a bass, a snare
a little cut over there
i add my name k-r-s
and the shit becomes fresh
i ask moe and icu for their thoughts
lay it down at power play all the suckas are taught
one again, the tactics of original arts
we're gettin' payed to the end cuz we were down from the start
we're known as boogie down productions, ain't no b-boy stance
guaranteed to make ya dance, if you give us a chance
we're goin' off and of course all ya suckas are lost
you wanna hear a fresh rhyme? you've come to the source
because i'm the type of guy who's not put up on a pedestal
run my rhyme on time and on schedule
one after another, another to the next
can't rhyme when you're tense, or your muscles won't flex
check your larynx
it may get lower havin' sex
or may get higher
when bustin' as a liar
these are the things i teach so be taught
to me you're kinda short, how many battles have you fought?
if you come up with a number, notebook, or list
it just doesn't matter, you can still get dissed
i'm bringin' back that ol' new york rap
that gets you jacked while you're hands still clap
it's funny
just dissin' you i can make money
but no one's tippin'
my message is simple: ya' slippin!
e-n-o, s-r-k
when you go through other albums, you're sure to say
""goddamn, they all seem to sound alike!""
till you hear the crew standin' over in the light
showing, glowing, on the top growing
the lyrics keep flowing and flowing and just flowing
just like a river, or better yet a stream
i'm proud to be down with the winning team
so don't ever in your life even think about a arguement
cuz you'll get walked on like carpet
we'll pick you up, and dust you off
stamp bdp on your head and you're off
but you would even change that to say instead
""i'm down cuz i got a bdp on my head!""
so just before you inherit that ass kicking
i suggest you wake right up cuz ya slippin'"

62,cinos lighthouse zone,cinos,Hip-Hop,"the light feels warm, im attracted to its presence, its honesty is bliss its divine from the heavens so i need exposure cause when you speak my heart gets warmer its like the perfect sandstorm ripping through my flesh exfoliating the past and leaving nothing left but i still hear liars i don't feel fire and my body glows illuminated yet flat lined submerged under the light i guess im baptized, i feel lonely, will you come hold me, but our love is feeling honestly its so strong the wind it whispers in my ear and says its so wrong but if jesus loves me then he wont touch me the light attracts peace to my heart and the pieces of my heart are broken into shards but when all put together all remains the truth as long as the fear of our existence remains glued the true serum of knowledge will have you hearing shit dreaming of nightmares until your living it don't say im concealing it i know someone's hearing this plight to unite every spike of a pyramid you look into the future see nothing its blank deserted i hope its all worth it these humans truly deserve it. for making us feel worthless im doing you all a service and giving your life purpose that shines from the glow of a light tower the final hour from the screams of a night owl, but he's who made you, but when you suffer then why hasn't he saved you. its different the effects from a lighthouse which points north but our paths seems to fly south you hear the ocean singing birds crying you feel weak nervous emotions dying to have the heart of a lion but missing love to support the ten commandments that's given instead you feel aborted taking a fall is the only way to start until you left out at sea drifting on noah's ark and aw quiet as you listen for her call till the kraken emerges and surely submerge you al but so what this world is disgusting im appalled who are you to judge me when you are so flawed i don't get it, it never felt right that's why i fell in love with misery attracted to the light so ill follow his command as it leads me hopefully to a place where ill receive peace"
63,you-could-be-blind,dmx,Hip-Hop,"[chorus 2x]
you could be blind
but you gon' see it when you need to see it
you gon' be fine
'cause you gon' be here when you need to be here
one of a kind
first free your mind, and then you'll free your spirit
go where i go, dog in my life
[verse 1]
now if you start with dirt, then you start with hurt
you start with ""oh, you ain't got?""
well here, take my shirt
start with work, blood and tears over the years
goin' through whatever we go through, we stickin' it out here
pups turn into dogs, tadpoles into frogs
i'm just eatin' what's in front of me, ain't thinking about yours
but i'ma keep my paws on what's mine
beg 'til i find
strapped 'til i'm blind
a nigga that whatever i do, still gon' be able to spit this
i'm wit' this, 'cause this is mine, you scared shitless
rap niggas can't fuck with the dog
never, could be twenty below outside
i'm built for the weather
it could be hotter than lava, i wouldn't bother to sweat
some of you niggas, form a following, but you startin' to forget
i paid my dues, not only did you not wear
but you would really love it
if you could meet that cat that made my shoes
c'mon!
[chorus 2x]
[verse 2]
now see, what i do is peep shit, keep shit low
keep paying attention to what you trying to show me
livin', but you never know, we livin'
don't give me what you don't owe me
don't tell me that you love me
don't talk shit, don't kill me slowly
'cause a dog like me, is an only
meaning, hit another like you, truth hurts, but i can't be phony
you always looking for bad, look at you mad
but you won't be satisfied 'til it took what you had
(aight) i'm a thoro nigga, i keep my word
and anybody that's ever met me, got love for me
so i keep a heard
and that shit y'all niggas told me got me fucked up in the head
went from, ""yo, that's my dog""
to, ""yeah, that nigga dead""
what the fuck is all this?
news to me
dog it's like shit ain't what it used to be
see some niggas choose to be on the other side of the fence
keep riding with this, get fried in the mix
c'mon!
[chorus 2x]
[verse 3]
now if it ain't that, then don't say that
'cause i don't play that, y'all play that
but the poke ain't black, damn, why you say that?
i thought that...what?
nevermind, i just thought it
we supposed to keep it real
i destroy what i was taught
misery, love, company
now you niggas talikin' 'bout jumpin' me, pumpin' me
full of slugs, blood, stud with the love
damn, i just gave, what a real, nigga does
don't listen to the buzz, don't get caught up in the hype
you'll lose everything that you worked for
trying to take a nigga's stripes
live life through life, and so on and so on
that's when the grow on, man, get your flow on
you niggas gettin' too old for this kid shit
on the real, we all done did shit to get shit
snake shit, right is better, wrong is wrong
mo'herfucker, listen to this song
you see what shit i'm on
c'mon!

yo, dog, don't even go there
this is ours; we built this from the ground on up
now it's flowers; i think you best a round on up
your entourage - slim chance of y'all gettin' large
it's non-cipher; that's because b.r.'s in charge
it's set here; cats is known for gettin' wet here
and left here, till the cops come pick us up
[mark curry]
step in a territory that's corrupt, pushin' your luck
intrudin' wishes is already sowed up; nigga fold up
you and your crew and peoples will get slain
this ain't the place to try and gain fame from
you gets burnt in the streets a nigga worked hard to make
and i'll be damned if i let another brother take it
alive for his own sake; they better vacate
promptly, 'fore they get they ass stomped
listen, take heed to what we sayin', niggas

we won't lie; sometimes we stick 'em up
last time, it was enough, though word life some hos did 'em up
and nine glocks set 'em up
i know it was your dough 'cause i was right there when they split it up
i could tell you where to find the corpse
but that cheddar - i'm afraid, dog, that's gone forever

greed for wealth got us stingy
we got a spot that's hot
niggas envy the fact that we clock mad dough
they want to see us shut down, but, no
i don't think so; the crew is still rakin' the cash flow
for every dime bag sold on this block, we want in
one slug behind the back; it's under the skin
when niggas try to step to the block and bogard
we can't see it happenin'
warn them first; get the fuck out of dodge
better believe that; test it
see if we won't put you on your back, niggas

you stupid; i wouldn't care how ruthless your crew is
we got defense on this area; try to attack
mad niggas on the barriers that's dyin' of blast back
there be no givin' and no takin', definitely no breakin'
laws we lay down; here's the situation
severe torture is what those who don't feel us face
i show no love for a punk-ass nigga we hate
try to pay me no bribe, then come up missin'
happens to hard-headed niggas when they don't listen
i gave you fair warnin' 'bout the danger you're messin' with
a stranger invadin' the street corners are goners
try me, if you think it's a lie, the attitude many niggas had
but in the process many die
thinkin' they can step to the block and bogard
and couldn't see it happenin'

back on the mic is the anti-depressor
ad-rock, the pressure, yes, we need this
the best is yet to come, and yes, believe this
leggo my eggo while i flex my ego
sip off my 'secco, dressed up tuxedo
sipping coffee, playing keno in the casino
want a lucky number, ask mike dino
i burn the competition like a flamethrower
my rhymes age like wine as i get older
i'm getting bolder, competition is waning
i got the feeling and assume the lane and
we got a party on the left, a party on the right
we gonna party for the motherfucking right to fight
make some noise if you're with me
make some noise if you're with me
armed insurrection, popular election
get paid every year like tax collection
hear my perfection, rotary connection
taking mc's down by lethal rap injection
i'm like an ornithologist when i get pissed
you must have drank a fizzy-lifting drink and you got lifted
and sifted, i'm just whiffed
and when i catch mcs it's time for wing-clipping
i fly like a hawk, or better yet an eagle
a seagull, i sniff suckers out like a beagle
my ego is off and running and gone
'cause i'm about the best and if you diss than that's wrong
we got a party on the left, a party on the right
we gonna party for the motherfucking right to fight
make some noise if you're with me
make some noise if you're with me
pass me the scalpel, i'll make an incision
i'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitching
put it in formaldehyde and put it in the shelf
and you can show it to your friends and say ""that's my old self""
can't do me nothing, can't tell me nada
don't quote me now because i'm doing the lambada
the forbidden dance, here's my chance
to make romance in my b-boy stance
parlay romancing into financing
opened up a restaurant with ted danson
the roaches checked in, but they never checked out
i set the record straight no doubt
we got a party on the left, a party on the right
we gonna party for the motherfucking right to fight
make some noise if you're with me

i be telling him, he inspired me to go harder
know what i'm saying, real talk
my savages, my savages, my savages
i'm always dressing fresher than a mannequin
i grew up in a ruthless ass environment
i'm on the phone with yo, i ask him how the trial went
35 racks is how my day was spent
i gotta cock it back, that's how my day would get
you got me thinking all these bitches artificial
the way you acting you must don't respect a real nigga
roll some herb up, pour some syrup up
they tried to infiltrate us and then betrayed us
i told you way before what happened they was hating on us
you know when we was juuging for it they was mad at us
aye, this a letter for my dogs
how we let the money get between us
how we let these bitches get between us
how we let these niggas get between us
i got love for all my savages with itchy fingers
i got love but it ain't like the love i got for india
she held me down when i was broke, i got her to infinity
my lil dog caught a murder, gone for infinity
dumping ashes on your obituary, i know you feeling me
rip my granddad quick, he should have seen this shit
20 thousand o's of child support, i seen that shit
riding round with all them choppers, i done seen this shit
these rappers mad at me but these niggas ain't doing shit
and i just bought a pound of kush so i can smoke that shit
i went and spent a half a ticket at the dealership

who would think we was poor?
there's money laying on the floor
got some hoes laying on some hoes
got a shawty with me, she a pro
no she'll never meet another nigga not another nigga like me
even if he got a billion dollars he can't make her cum like me

99,wu-tang-forever,drake,Hip-Hop,"i just love when i'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten

you would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
what made me think about the game, girl

it's yours, that's for sure
how you feel about, coming home with a, nigga for the night?
if you nervous, hit the lights, i know we only fucking out of spite
cause your man don't do you right, do you right, i could fuck you so good
then i hit you with the 9 a.m. in dallas who you like, baby, who you like
machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
i just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
it's about who did it right, niggas looking like ""preach""
open cases on me for a half a million each
i find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets
i know, luckily i didn't have to grow there
i would only go there cause there's niggas that i know there
i don't know what's getting into me
i just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
and you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
you ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
people like mazin who was a best friend to me
start to become a distant memory
things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy
and fucking with me mentally, i think it's meant to be
paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
but you gotta understand when it's yours
they don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man
i just love when i'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
we used to be friends, girl, and even back then
you would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours

only skin that won't be tatted will be my face
and i'll be ridin my life to the death at own pace

[verse 1: brother ali]
faith in god high thinking and simple livin'
work hard deep love no conditions
gentle heart head level clear vision
back tall firm in our conviction
smile through the tears laugh through the tragedy
all we got is each other must love radically
passionately peaceful fight for it fanatically
premium on people magic humanity
dance as if no one's looking sing like no one's listenin'
live and love out loud and let your spirit glisten
feet firm in the dirt head in the sky
serve when the sun is at work dream when he hides
and know that the water that well up in your eye
is the same when a loved one is born as when they die
as sure as every hello is eventually goodbye
the art of truly living is learning how to die
[hook: choklate & tone trezure]
wherever you go
may the good lord bless your heart and soul
my beloved my beloved my beloved
i want you to know
that your love and your wisdom touched me so
my beloved my beloved my beloved

bless your soul so precious and delicate
powerfully compassionate, your friendship
held me together when the threat of unraveling
had me at the brink feeling inadequate
when the sky got dreary my eyes got teary, my
heart got weary you were right there near me
only reason i ain't laid up in some cemetery
is when i was in fear somebody cared enough to hear me
anything that i do in this life of mine
from this point is part you for the gifts you provide
only way to repay you is live right and shine
trust me when i tell you you're still on my mind

young lovers passion in their stare
hanging in the air challenging their fears
catch a passing moment and grab it in the clear
desperately attempting to stretch it into years
her soft and elegant he firm and gallant
words dancing between them hanging in the balance
grins and glances translate every sentence
into a language where the future smiles at us
love's not careful neither is it fearful
the thought of living without is unbearable
so listen young lady this me thanking you
no matter what you will always have my gratitude

sometimes i feel like i'm caught in a verse
or i'm bobby fischer but nobody cared to search
can't look my mother in the eye no mo'
can't tell her that the god don't get high no mo'
its the begining of a train wreck
hold ya heart cause believe me the camera won't explain it
or contain it, an angel said ""free""
was i really what you wanted me to be?
you trust the soul of the icey cold
because they bump you where guns and the drugs is sold
and where the gods said they're born to roll
and they'll think like this until they gray and old
i think back to when i was drug free, care free
but that was long ago kinda like a memory
do you remember me? man it was long ago
we used to like each other livin in the fillmoe
you never said no i never said hoe
but like i said in the begining that was long ago
and from the start yo you knew i wasnt mozart
marvin gaye always said life comes apart
and like a puzzle, some times it gets worse
i'd probably break down if i step into church
[equipto]
man
we had dreams of doin things with money
its funny how situations get ugly
i usta believe when a girl says she love me
but now i take off, don't look back and keep runnin'
a hundred miles an hour i'm hidin my smile
but now i find time just for writin it down..huh
it's kill joy, i'm still your boy
'til then i'ma build and destroy
and fill the void
i keep sinnin in this sensitive world
though i've never gotten this for a lesson to learn...(never)
baby keep askin me when i'd return
not knowin' i'm a playa in every sense of the word..huh
my momma cry she know i ain't livin right
can't legiaimize who i am in her mind
am i blind or just too ignorant?
i'd give my life to feel that innocent
i can't look back
bags is packed
sayin ""won't nobody know where i'm at"" ..(gone)
across the map
no contact leave the phone
rollin stone, and rarely be at home
i got a plan to get away
hustlin' a family
we can live for betta days
or i mean happy
but everything comes with time
one heart
one luv
one life

i'm gas, your whole click is ass, i mean that.
g-unot cocksucker, better believe that
i say it one time, watch the whole world scream back
g-u-n-o-t, now thats for billboard, rest in peace
and since my nigga died, i been stress no sleep
contemplating suicide in my lexus jeep
i tried twice but i couldn't make my death complete
i guess you could say mya got the best of me
came back from the dead to address the beef
kiss my converse bitch and accept defeat
cause i hate it when bullies try to test the weak
thats when i go bishop and juice and start flexin heat
you could get it in the stomach just like raheem
cause running with a snitch is not quite my thing
i tried to take buck with me, but he stayed on the scene
guess all i can do now is pray for supreme
while i finish my next album, 5 million and countin
anticipating, tellin the world i did it without him
if aftermath was a family that didn't have a mother
i'd be dre's newborn, you'd be the jealous older brother
yea, daddy love us but in the meanwhile
you talkin behind his back and in his face you smile
you moved out the house, you a failure now
and lil' game grew up to be a problem child
i whip yo head boy, that's for kanye west
i whip yo head boy, with the back of my tech
yeap, your fuckin group fell flat without me
you mad, what you gonna do rap about me?
your bars is park garbage, hooks is mediocre

hurricanes in stores the day after christmas, nigga fuck reeboks

it was dr. dre that took me out the weed spot.
you want credit, forget it, i did it on my own
gave you 300 bars, then said i'm gone
but i'm back, this is rap and a fact is a fact
they say once you turn snitch, you never go back

homie got cheese, but he dont feed no rats
i show the world my dick if lloyd banks go plat

153,united-minds,arrested-development,Hip-Hop,"united minds of america
make your vocal chords reach the clouds and
touch the crowd of folks that over-stand there's no jokes
we must network together as one and
tell the oppressor we'll take no less than
total justice a social setting yo i'm bettin'
we can stop new world order
start servin' liberty may i take your order
free political prisoners without no question
let's give props where due
if it was you wouldn't you want to know
that someone cares for what you do so let's show
political prisoners, homeless humans, organizations
various movements
that the people in america have some discipline
to act on their belief therefore stress activism
although you are only one person
if for truth you still thirst well thirst then
make the difference by joining
some organization or some movement
let me explain the powers that be
are families of power with old money
unfortunately on their souls hangs a sold sign
and in righteous sight they are so blind!
infatuated with their power and their greed
they don't see that god is the answer
greed has planted a seed within the souls of the 13 families
drug dealers and hustlers
all my brothers and sisters that are hustlers
selling crack cocaine to your followers
to me you're a sell out an uncle tom
in the tom tom club droppin' bombs
causing confusion shootin' and killin'
you're playin the role putting fear in populations
making us allow the system to ""protect"" us
allowing the chicken snake to protect the chickens
police brutality claiming victims
the powers that be may come with their solutions
but trust me their trees bear no fruits no
i guess that's why i get spiritual
spirituality supports reality no not catholic no not baptist
no not passive
very active!
united minds of the americas
minds of africa and the caribbean
and the europeans and the asians and australians
it's not just race we're all in this together!
lets play a game of jeopardy what's the question?
social medicines the answer
i try to eat healthy to avoid the cancer
one ounce of prevention beats 100 pounds of cure
pure ways of living is not hippish
it's not white not black it's just conscious
conscious of your health, conscious of your self
instead of being so damn conscious of your wealth
(or lack of so)
do you know about the panthers,
the move organization, kwame
nkrumah, the zulu nation or just nikes and pumas
or your fascination with the so-called be-boy fashion nation.
if you can please recycle
even the people in the hood please recycle
i know it wasn't our fault that they went psycho
they meaning industry exec's who flex for profit!
traditional societies and islanders
please retain your culture and don't give up!
don't you understand we must understand this
if we want to live in bliss"

she said she shouldve done this
she shouldve done that
pack my bags and never look back
some things that ive seen i cant un-see
ive spent my whole life just trying to get free
and im never gonna bewithout my pain and misery
but i remember what my mama told me (mama told me)
mama told me (mama told me)
i remember what my mama told me
[verse 1: chino xl]
i scramble to my feet to regain consciousness
the floor half full of blood, im a pessimist
it makes sense for me to make my exodus
this scene flashing through child monic movie images
i was nine years old with spine hemorrhages
just me and him was in the house, no witnesses
all im thinking is, how im a live through this
he unclenched his fist, my face grimaces
i dont reminisce, i remember the stress
feeling nervousness when he came home up the steps
mom he beatin' me bad first escaped my lips
she said that i was a fuck up and i deserved this shit
what could i have possibly done i was only nine
with fucking stitches in my eye she told me stop crying
im looking for a sign, the sun dont ever shine
im an only child; they say that love is blind
[refrain: chino xl & akili nickson]
she said she shouldve done this
she shouldve done that
pack my bags and never look back
some things that ive seen i cant un-see
ive spent my whole life just trying to get free
and im never gonna bewithout my pain and misery
but i remember what my mama told me (mama told me)
mama told me (mama told me)
i remember what my mama told me
[verse 2: chino xl]
now in retrospect as a father looking back
having my own flesh of my flesh
theres no excuse for that
i also have heard that what dont kill us make us stronger
but the abuse that i took, took away my hunger
living inside my imagination i learned hate
planning my escape, losing my personal faith
she blamed it on the drugs; she blamed it on the times
she blamed on her moms, but im the one with scars
staring at that chipped paint wall in my room
im 13 years old now i gotta do something soon
it was the 6th of june inside my mouth was a bloody wound
my step father vowed to put in me in a tomb
momma told me my real daddy didnt want me
i figured this new man must be special if she let him hurt me
now i aint have a mother, and he aint have no mercy
why did god curse me? maybe im meant to suffer
[refrain: chino xl & akili nickson]
she said she shouldve done this
she shouldve done that
pack my bags and never look back
some things that ive seen i cant un-see
ive spent my whole life just trying to get free
and im never gonna bewithout my pain and misery
but i remember what my mama told me (mama told me)
mama told me (mama told me)
i remember what my mama told me
[verse 3: chino xl]
i finally decided that i wouldnt take it no more
i had a steak knife that ive been hiding in my right drawer
he had punch my right jaw just the night before
i stood silently outside his bedroom door
but every breath i took i felt like there was angels with me
soon his death would be a mystery even to me
i saw a shadow move, he finally coming through
i swung a knife at dude, if i had only knew
the life slipping out a body was my mom dukes
i had no idea that she was in the room too
wiping tears from my eyes this cant be true
my step father drunk in the bed still off cheap brew
i knelled down to momma to hear a last truth
she said son i never loved him more than you
i still hate myself, i tried to hang myself
the leather belt broke, that was 20 years ago
[chino xl & akili nickson]
refrain x2
she said she shouldve done this
she shouldve done that
pack my bags and never look back
some things that ive seen i cant un-see
ive spent my whole life just trying to get free
and im never gonna bewithout my pain and misery
but i remember what my mama told me (mama told me)
mama told me (mama told me)
i remember what my mama told me"

uhh as the world mourning mehn i keep smiling
i dont give a fuck what they gonna say bout me
mehn im stunnin hard, damn i worked hard tryna count up effort must be a retard
moving too fast outcome was got in 10 days
climbing from level to level like a staircase
never gonna quit mehn amma scarface
you niggaz twisted i guess i call you shoe lace
red jordans in the box with some snap bulls
im on my boss shit
chillin always break rules
most niggas out there mayne i call them fools
why they tryna fuck with me and think they gonna get loosed
never getting tired burn forever like a fire
to never fade, get money, make heaven thats my desire
couple niggaz hating make me famous getting higher
anyone who says not hated is a fuckin bloody liar
couple haters claim your friend they wanna bring you down
you stunnin hard they gonna change you from white down to brown
you feelin low now the pressure gonna make you frown
the only time you gonna rise is when you see the crown
true fact
fuck the game
with a new style
digging harder than the niggaz in the school farm
achieving big doing it like a big jam
you mess with me homicide boom bam
mehn im the shit
niggah killin on the beat
rapping hard niggaz in east even feel my heat
they say when you fall you gotta get back on ur feet
but freeze is never gonna fall seating on the firmest seat
i set the pace leadin niggaz in the right way
flamboyant people out just say chill in your estate
out running all my mates number nine on my jersey
mayne amma keep fighting down jet li
they watch me like a movie tell me im their favourite actor
they say they like the way i speak wisdom of a pastor
loving every bit of me like feel like im their doctor
always keep my shoulder stay high im the master"

why you niggas look mad?
y'all supposed to be happy i'm free!
y'all niggas look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail
ho bustas!
picture me rolling in my 500 benz
i got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
they got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be telling
know there's dope being sold, but i ain't the one selling!
don't want to be another number
i gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from going under
the federales wanna see me dead
niggas put prices on my head
now i got two rottweilers by me bed, i feed 'em lead
now i'm released, how will i live?
will god forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
one life to live, it's so hard to be positive
when niggas shooting at your crib
mama, i'm still thugging, the world is a war zone
my homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
full grown, finally a man, just scheming on ways
to put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
just picture me rollin'
flossing a benz on rims that isn't stolen
my dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
i'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
my nerves is wrecked, heart beating and my hands are swollen
thinking of the g's i'll be holdin', picture me rollin'
can you see me now? (oh picture me rollin')
move to the side a little bit so you can get a clear picture
can you see it?
picture me rollin' (picture me rollin')
yeah nigga!
ay, but peep how my nigga syke do it to you
guess who's back?
i got keys coming from overseas
cost a nigga 200 g's
i'm a street commando, nino for example
this lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
so i got to floss 'cause i'm more like a boss player
thug, branded to be a women-layer
so many player haters, imitators steady swanging
make me wanna start back banging
so i'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
packing 40 glocks, contain em or rearrange
all that jealousy and envy coming from my enemies
while i'm sipping on remy
in front of black lexus, chevy's on the roam
'96 big body, sitting on chrome
as we head up out the zone, stone-facing is on
you can admire, but don't look too long
i'm living a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin'
it's hard to imagine picture me rollin'!
picture, picture me rollin'
rollin', picture me rollin'
wheelin', picture me rollin'
picture me yea yeah
i gots to get the fuck up in it
formulate a caper
'cause a nigga straight suffering from lack of having paper
my bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
so i needs to hit a lick, drastically
i see some ballin' ass niggas, and they slippin' in my spot
and, uh, diggin' the plots (so what?)
checking in the park, 'pac

a 4 [degree] c rise in temperature would put many of you at risk of coastal flooding, causing 30-50% reduction in water availability, in southern africa and the mediterranean. agricultural yields will decline. 20-50% of animal and plant species would face extinction.

then the path that we choose
is our own til we save our planet
renovate all traffic
innovate more atmospheric
brace all damage
done away with
maybe some escape to another planet
face mutated
in a spaceship
travelling in spaces
examining the ways of man
and how we take advantage of
the place we inhabit it
and taste more lavish shit
racism hatred we did got past it
but we may all be prey to the wrath of mother nature

232,craftsmanship,buck-65,Hip-Hop,"most folks spend their days daydreaming of finding clues
my whole life i've been here at the train station shining shoes
i started when i was nine, on my own and taught myself
no complaints, i'm doing pretty good and i got my health
memories and callouses, my hearing's probably next to go
sometimes i do a little handywork for extra dough
but mostly this here is how i spend my time
and i've perfected a technique i call the dry shine
some guys use lots of water on the shoe but then when it's out in the open air
the shine is gone in 10 minutes
that whole approach to the job is dumb, in fact
dollars to donuts, that customer won't be coming back
this is the most common mistake of the amateurs
going for big numbers to satisfy their managers
anyway, the dry shine, the first thing i mean to do
and this part is very important
i clean the shoe: the residue and old polish
to keep a shoe from being ruined all you need to do is use a rag with some cleaning fluid
if the shoe's all caked up with gunk you need to think
the shoe can't breathe and that's what causes the feet to stink
they took carfoine off the market, i believe
it was a few years ago, 'cause that leather couldn't breathe
now once you've cleaned the shoe and it's dried
your base coat of polish can now be applied
then you brush, 'cause what that tends to do
is clean the shoe a little more and gets rid of the residue
and then you do the second coat just like the first one
you brush it, you rag it, and voila, your work is done
and that's it
you treat each shoe like it's special
care about your work, and be a professional
there's a right way to go about your job and a wrong one
i find this way is much better in the long run
it ain't about the dollar or trying to go fast
unless you take pride in what you're doing you won't last
craftsmanship is a quality that some lack
you got to give people a reason for them to come back
the world's a different place than what i was introduced to
they don't wear shineable shoes like they used to
casual clothes in the office, what is this?
the villain in sneakers is killing my business"

238,hailie-and-me,eminem,Hip-Hop,"yo, i can't sing but i feel like singing
i wanna fuckin' sing
'cuz i'm happy, yeah, i'm happy
i got my baby back, yo, check it out
somedays i sit staring out the window
watchin' this world pass me by
sometimes i think there's nothin' to live for
i almost break down and cry
sometimes i think i'm crazy, i'm crazy, oh, so crazy
why am i here? am i just wasting my time?
but then i see my baby, suddenly i'm not crazy
it all makes sense when i look into her eyes, oh, no
'cuz sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
everyone's leaning on me
'cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
but then she comes back to me
my baby girl keeps getting' older
i watch her grow up with pride
people make jokes 'cuz they don't understand me
they just don't see my real side
i act like shit, don't phase me, inside it drives me crazy
my insecurities could eat me alive
but then i see my baby, suddenly i'm not crazy
it all makes sense when i look into her eyes, oh, no
'cuz sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
everyone's leaning on me
'cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
but then she comes back to me
man, if i could sing, i'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
if i could hit the notes, i'd blow something as long as my father
to show her how i feel about her, how proud i am that i got her
god, i'm a daddy, i'm so glad that her mom didn't
now you probably get this picture from my public persona
that imma pistol packin' drug addict, who bags on his mama
but i wanna to just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'cuz there's a lot of shit i keep bottled, that hurts deep inside
of my soul and just know that i grow colder the older i grow
this boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
and this load is like the weight of the world
and i think my neck is breakin'
should i just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
now look, i love my daughter more than life in itself
but i got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
but i handle it well, given the circumstances i'm dealt
so many chances, man, it's too bad, could have had someone else
but the years that i've wasted is nothing to the tears that i've tasted
so here's what i'm facin', 3 felonies, 6 years of probation
i've went to jail for this woman, i've been to bat for this woman
i've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
man, i should have seen it coming, what i stick my penis up in?
wouldn't have ripped the pre-nup up if i'da seen what she was fuckin'?
but fuck it, it is over, there's no more reason to cry no more
i got my baby, baby, the only lady that i adore, hailie
so sayonara, try tommorra, nice to know ya
our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
and suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
it's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted
and now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
everyone's leaning on me
'cuz my baby knows that her dad's a soldier
nothing can take her from me
told you i can't sing
oh, well, i tried
hailie, remember when i said
if you ever need anything
daddy would be right there?
guess what? daddy's here
and i ain't going nowhere
baby, i love you"

""mcing, and djing from your own mind, ya know?""
""i, i guess right now we should start the show""
who's the suspicious character strapped with the sounds profound
similar to rounds spit by derringers
you're in the terrordome like my man chuck d said
it's time to dethrone you clones, and all you knuckleheads
cause mc's have used up extended warranties
while real mc's and dj's are a minority
but right about now, i use my authority
cause i'm like the wizard and you look lost like dorothy
the horror be when i return for my real people
words that split wigs hittin like some double desert eagles
sportin caps pulled low, and baggy slacks
subtractin all the rappers who lack, over premier's tracks
severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
so as i have in the past, i whup ass
droppin lyrics that be hotter than sex and candlewax
and one-dimensional mc's can't handle that
while the world's revolvin, on it's axis
i come with mad love and plus the illest warlike tactics
the wilderness is filled with this; so many people
searching for false lift, i'm here with the skills you've missed
the rejected stone is now the cornerstone
sort of like the master builder when i make my way home
you know my steez
""you know my steez""
""let em know, do your thing y'all""
""keep it live""
""to the beat y'all""
the beat is sinister, primo makes you relax
i'm like the minister, when i be lacin the wax
i be bringin salvation through the way that i rap
and you know, and i know, i'm nice like that
work through worldly problems, i got the healing power
when the mic's within my reach, i'm feelin more power
stealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
it's often easier for one, to give advice
than it is for a person to run one's own life
that's why i can't be caught up in all the hype
i keep my soul tight and let these lines takes flight
the apparatus gets blessed, and suckers get put to rest
no more of the unpure i got the cure for this mess
the wackness is spreadin like the plague
mc's lucked up and got paid but still can't make the fuckin grade
how many times are wannabe's gonna lie?
yo they must wanna fry, they can't touch the knowledge i personify
i travel through the darkness carrying my torch
the illest soldier, when i'm holding down the fort
(""you know my steez"")
you know my steez
""let em know, do your thing y'all""
""keep it live""
""you know my steez""

on the microphone you know that i'm one of the best yet
some punks, ain't paid all of their debts yet
tryin to be fly, ridin high on the jet-set
with juvenile rhymes makin fake-ass death threats
big deal, like en vogue, here's something you can feel
styles more tangible, and image more real
for some time now, i've held the scrolls and manuscripts
when it's time to go all out you be like, ""damn he flipped""
now i'm sick, fed up with the bullshit
got the lyrical full clip, giving you a verbal asswhip
don't trip it's the gifted prolific one
known as bald head slick why is the press all on my di-dick?
my style be wilder, than a kamikaze pilot
don't try it, i'm about to start more than a friggin riot
styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas, yo
them motherfuckers are harrassable
for i be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond
the mic's either a magic wand
or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
then i grab your palm, no pulse you're gone
and if you thought we'd lose our niche in this rap shit you way wrong
i stay up, i stay on, shine bright, like neon
your song's, pathetic, synthetic, like rayon

it is what it is, it aint what it was. fakers keepin it real, haters deeper than love. nothin leaves, nothin you get what you earn. as you reach valleys and peaks, you live and you learn. it is what it is, it aint what it was. fakers keepin it real, haters deeper than love. nothin leaves, nothin you get what you earn. as you reach valleys and peaks, you live and you learn.
as you mature, move on, forgive and forget. but be aware, some things you live to regret. they say know your enemy, remember your friend. who against you becuz he aint no different from him. especially when you on and he wish you was him, in the position you in, thats when resentment begins to manifest how insecure he mentally is. a weak nigga, affectin his potential to win. love is a home, hate is where treachery lives around the corner from death, drama, and felony bids. tomorrows not promised, today is a gift. the present determines what your legacy is. what you did yesterday you can never relive. to pursue it is the question what your relevance is. recognize the truth, so you better prepare, for lifes numerous tests or your destined to fail.
it is what it is, it aint what it was. fakers keepin it real, haters deeper than love. nothin leaves, nothin you get what you earn. as you reach valleys and peaks, you live and you learn.it is what it is, it aint what it was. fakers keepin it real, haters deeper than love. nothin leaves, nothin you get what you earn. as you reach valleys and peaks, you live and you learn."

257,back-to-88,dead-celebrity-status,Hip-Hop,"i could make a earth shake, i'm your worst mistake,
between skinny dipping and camp crystal lake.
i feel like rob zombie, my thoughts are morbid,
like i slept in his house of a thousand corpses.
put on a page, could shatter a giant's ribcage,
crush you and anyone that listen's to rage,
a vision of rage, it's like swimming with great whites.
slain mics, step up and feel the break tight.
i always like to show some decency,
but music always brings out the beast in me.
it's an animalistic misfit, so why risk it?
''cause this shit will leave a large imprint.
it's an instant classic, if not then it's close to it.
you disagree then you don't know music.
most emcees that garble when it's time to write,
they got nothing to say, like a deaf man with writers block.
it's an animalistic so fuck what your friends think.
i work wonders with the pen's ink.
so what's a quote from your favourite artist?
if it aint dead celeb then it's probably garbage.
long time coming, 15 years in the making,
it's finally come, but my lungs are acheing.
watch how i make the beat bleed,
strangle the music 'till it can't breathe.
on it's whole, words are the life support.
without me the song dies. without me then it's lifeless.
without me i'm just another fucking rapper with a crisis,
and a collection of songs about being rich.
life's a big chain, it pushed you in the only which it ### thought containment.
we call it entertainment and you could love it or hate it.
you could turn it up, or turn it off, or just embrace it.
there's just too many stakes to regard it, all of them.
and they are starving and they feed off of music.
walking zombies who choose to follow,
yeah some can spit, but most swallow.
i was always told that rabbit seized the moment.
that's why i write with emotion.
sing 'til i spit blood, sing for the hopeless,
sing 'til my lungs give out, and my throat closes.
that's just my ambition, to turn heads like a street magician.
david blaine stopped paying attention.
it's the main attraction, the world premier.
dead celeb i thought i made it perfectly clear,
that i would not back down or stumble.
i just pace, back and forth, like a lion inside of a jungle.
this is my domain me and a mic go together,
like robert downey junior and cocaine.
i'm just an addict, i got a bad habit,
of making the best emcees seem below average.
i'm just savage. i'm more than you bargain for.
that's why i hold the mic up into my arm and soar.
lyrics are swarming i'm more than a hurricane,
and when i'm on it i'm more than a great white shark.
when i'm storming i'm ###.
and i don't like any of these rappers causing me boredom.
i kick a hole in the speaker once i'm done recording.
and my voice cuts sooner, cuts a chainsaw in texas.
i got a face and it's fatal weapons.
watch me rip the flesh from the beat
skin it alive and hang a song from his feet.
''cause inside i'm dark and dingy,
like donnie darko was trapped within me.
i'm starving like the streets of harlem.
and a quest that became with a ring like golem.
my precious, we need you, quick.
we need you like dead celebrity's blood music.
and i'm a scriptling direct from hell.
i'm hungry like when cannabis first battled darnel.
i've come to rock down, you rock as my pumps.
i take this to new heights like suicide jumps.
you only live once, ### hunts.
and i get bloody, like it's the time of the month, bitch.
for those that can't spell, it's y-a-s,
the most dangerous letters in the alphabet.
''cause facing me is like speaking english in thailand,
there's really no point, like blindfolding a blind man.
dcs are the initials, for kids who got issues,
for kids who fight back like pitbulls.
you wanna battle? check my win column.
i got two middle fingers with your name written on them. what?!"

nicklebacks and headies got me feeling kind of awesome
star sons, zodiac debilitated mars but
got the bars to bag it up that asher roth's a raw one
on the road to riches, i ain't make it very far cause
seems that i desire more than calabasas cars
caviar always tasting kind of blah to me (honestly)
keeping a facade kind of hard to me (hard to be)
anything you isn't actually that's kinda awkward
student with a lisp and stutters spelling out a long word
law firm, strong earn, got two degrees
but don't mean he got the means to kick rhythm on the beat
eating breakfast on the beach with my tutti fruiti honey pie
she can be wherever, she ain't comfortable with other guys
the way i rub her feet underneath vanilla skies
chocolate covered compliments can't help if she got better style
let it slide, leather sandals on, stellar vibe
i can probably stunt it if i want it but i never try
that's just me, og, old soul

those past life's get bright late at night
wouldn't trade a day of this life's fight to get right

and for once chicks would dig him and then think he was legit

i'm compulsive, psychotic in the mental
a walking fear factor, seven thirty, it's that simple
i've been exposed to a universe of negative fallout
the fact that i move on nothing, it makes me wanna ball out
instead, i put vocals to the beats and get it popping
the harm glare right through the track, i feel like rocking
but back to the program, damn
my evil and is taking over like i'm sinking in some quicksand
really i feel like going up in a blaze, hot damn

with five million ways to bust heads, so forgive my slide

from sunday, monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday
friday and even on saturday, it's like i'm trapped in a box
uh-huh, going to war with myself
so i can't stop thinking about killing myself
so i do what i do, to do what i do, to break the rules
only form of therapy is to spit it for you
charismatically drastic with this rap shit
thoughts are falling off but send them back like elastic
get the politic sorrows in the music game
i'm trynna make sense of corruption in my brain

my hearts on my sleeve, my loves growing and growing
that's how i like, from the music i make rumble
from the forty come licks, that's right i watch 'em crumble

competition is none i remain at the top like the sun
and i burn whoever come in the chambers of torture
i caught ya you shoulda brought ya
neighborhood to support ya
no one in my path will withstand
under pressure the wrath of a swift man
you name the day the grounds to be neutral
speak your piece the feeling's mutual
we can go topic from topic whenever i drop it
try to stop it
in other words, what the brother heard
he tried to catch it, but what occurred
was too much weight for one brain to take
try to concentrate maintain then elevate
program an ounce from pound to pound
the matter of weight can't hold my mind down
permanent damage, i do away with
no time for fun, cause i don't play with
competitors, there's only one when i'm done
competition is none

no competition

competition is none, i'm the soul survivor
mc's get live but i get liver
it ain't a memorex, live in concert
at every network, the are the expert
whoever goes against causes friction
introduction music where's the mixing
ra will never die, tools they never try
to beat or defeat me, because whenever i
put poetry in motion
from the nile, then out into the ocean
three-fourths of water makes seven seas
a third of land three-sixty degrees
i circulate and remain to rotate
seven days a week at a quake or a slow rate
be prepared whenever i come
competition is none

creator, the alphabets let's communicate
when i translate the situation's straight
no dictionary's necessary to use
big words do nothing but confuse and lose
from the first step, a concept was kept
to the end of the rhyme, it get more in-depth
all thoughts i come across, my mind's the source
made by the are, of course
seven holes in my face as i'm lookin out my window
speak with the beat and it seem like the wind blows
through the speakers, i hear it so pump this
and we can fill up the whole circumfrence
with competition, on an impossible mission
comin up with nothin, keep fishin
no runner up, just lost or forfeits
they all get butterflies, soon as the dog gets
unlocked, lines for blocks and blocks
might be triflin, to call the cops
bring along paramedics
but that won't help you, not even calisthetics
i'm god, g is the seventh letter made
rainin on rappers, there's no parade
so if you ain't wise, then don't even come

if i had known the altar wasn't meant for me
now i know there's treasure hidden in these scars

now i know what it took for me to survive
but now i know where to go to become alive

they'll never take me alive

cocked on these suckas, time to die
even as a youngster causin' ruckus on the back of the bus
i was a fool all through high school kickin' up dust
but now i'm labelled as a trouble maker who can you blame?
smokin' weed helped me take away the pain
so i'm hopeless
rollin' down the freeway swervin, don't worry
i'm about to crash up on the curb, cause my visions blurry
maybe if they tried to understand me
what should i do?
i had to feed my fuckin' family
what else could i do?
but be a thug
out slangin' with the homies
fuck hangin' with them phonies in the clubs
got my mind on danger
never been a stranger to homicide
my city's full of gang bangers and drive-bys
why do we die at an early age?
he was so young
but still a victim of the 12 gauge
my memories of a corpse
mind full of sick thoughts
and i ain't goin' back to court
so fuck what you thought
i'm drinkin' hennessey
runnin from my enemies
will i live to be 23?
there's so much pain

what would you do, if you couldn't sing, like a mary j?
what would you do, if you couldn't hit a white ball, like tyga?
if you wanted to model, but you wasn't skinny like tyra?
what if you wanted to be eminem
but the closet thing to him, was a pack of m&m;'s?
you can be eminem, and i got proof
or you could be obama, and bring back troops
or you could be osama, and tear off roofs
or be corporate america, and reject all youth
be the fly on the woodgrain, inside my coop
or be the sole, inside my shoe
so you can see where i walk, you can see where i been
see my father raping my sister when she was just ten

i told god i wanna quit, my nigga wouldn't let me
16, my freestyles are legendary
they be like ""yo chip, where's ice kid?""
i'm like ""blud, do i look like his secretary?""
head top bars, no frisky flows
chipmunk from the school of risky roadz
and your ballerina raps can't test the flow
with your ankles out, stay on your toes
i don't know how it feels to queue to rave
i've been popping since drinking underage
me, i've got like 13 mixtapes, 2 albums, an ep
and i still got more to say
i've got bars for days, now who wants a page?
i can feel the eyes, yeah, they're all on me

and i'm tired of fiends askin for a dime for nine
hearing this next punch line from me, may sound strange
you sit your 5-dollar ass down, before i make change
yo the sale went stale, caught em real bad
fresh out the jail, shit is really real
niggas is still in jail, and i pray they don't tell
20-man inditement, my lawyer gotta fight this
niggas know, i ain't never pressed for dough
and niggas know, i don't serve nobody i don't know
son said he was from o.t., pay 11 an o.z.
my man brought em to me, see he ain't really know b
that it was hot, dude was a cop
he was just tryin to pop, to put the new beams on his drop
first i served him o.z.'s, then i served him whole keys
now we all co-de's, damn man i o.d.
you know how it is on the street, niggas is holdin the heat
po-po walking to beat, we burnin l's up in the jeep
ain't nothing sweet, we used to move so strategic
it's over i can't believe it, damn it's over
fed's ceased the six, the lex' and the range rover
now a nigga rollin in a toyota corolla
used to never get high, now i'm never sober
380-6 shot glock top load-up
keep it in my waist son, i'll put one in your face
i ain't got nothing to lose, nigga so stay in your place
just jumped bail, i ain't been on the run long
but it feel like a motherfuckin marathon"

the u-n-holy, like ya told me
brothas under estimated and don't know me
this is a prophecy that's bound to come true
what's mine, is in your mind, out ya mind, ya mind blew
some on their knees prayin' to stop these
poisonous lyrics of death and disease
can't freeze, i think below but still flow
suckas are scared, i'm gettin' paid off the devil
i'ma use it, kinda confuse it
never abuse it, 'cause it's that music
it's that head bangin' acid rap
unholy's back to bust yo' ear drum with the wicket track
i take the tack, to break the back to back the fact
i rock the house whether white or black
so if i sold the soul to rock the gold
and jam the jam with a mic in my hand, you're like damn
there that brotha go enough to smother another
and make 'em suffer it gets no rougher
than the acid rap, i'll never pass it or gas it
all i ask is that you play it as a flow

now he's thinking back up to the party, he's regretting it
but he's deep in it, and there's nothing he can do, but to call his boo
who be at home, taking care of his one year old
he says, situation's thick, there's niggas after me
it ain't no stopping them, until they capping me (naw)
hold the fort down, i.ll be aight, i.ll give you a call in the morn
she says there's two up on my floor, with one kicking down my door
he calls his man nick, to check the situation (situation)
when he arrives all he sees is an assassination (assassination)
and when they one step ahead, so now an ambush is in the waiting
understand, you need to understand, my man
(you need to recognize and realize, boy!)
[chorus: x2]
now there's vengeance on the mind, time for him to take back what's stolen
he tells jermaine to meet him at the docks
at 5 o.clock, keep the glocks cocked
i got the blueprints, to run up on these niggas (word up dog!)
so when the time comes for them to meet
he sees the car, but finds jermaine slumped in the driver seat (what to do)
people cut themselves off of him, cause if they down they be shot too
his mother's in the rage, face on the front page
now the man's after him, the clan's after him, mob's after him
he's still at damage son, last thought's killing (uh)
the only thought in his head, now to do is run
buys his ticket at the international pier son
not, knowing that there's man
standing behind .em with, 9-millimeters in hand (he turns around to his surprise)
feels the burning on the inside, cold on the outside
and the people did the shooting, got away up with his life-time (ah-yo)
[chorus: x3]
(you fucking with your life boy)
yeah, (uh-uh) wild niggas (uh-uh, wild niggas)
you fucking with your life boy

393,i it all starts with that power and camp,childish gambino,Hip-Hop,"this world donald has talked about creating was born way back in 2011 on his debut album ""camp"", without us even being aware of it. the final track on the album, ""that power"" features a large monologue spoken by donald, or the boy, speaking about his experience with this girl whom he met on the camp. the boy is thirteen years old at this point [quote: ""that power""] and i think just after a point i'm just talking to lengthen the time where we live in a world where you haven't said ""yes"" or ""no"" yet. and regrettably i end up using the word ""destiny."" [end quote] when he runs out of things to say to this girl, he falls asleep, and wakes up at the pickup point where all the parents are collecting their kids. as he gets off the bus, the girls from the back of the bus run into the boy and mock him for what he said to the girl who he'd spent the bus ride home talking to. he expresses that he didn't know the girl was friends with these other girls, because it appears as though when the boy was asleep, the girl he was talking to decide to share what he told her the boy states that he learned to cut out the middle man all the time and just tell everyone, because they're going to find out somehow anyway. [maybe this is maybe why we're getting such a personal album from donald in ""because the internet"", because he is cutting out the middle man and just expressing his feelings and emotions through is music.] the boy finishes [quote: ""that power""] i wish i could say this was a story about how i got on the bus a boy and got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit. but that's not true. the truth is i got on the bus a boy. and i never got off the bus. i still haven't [end quote] the album ""camp"" seems to take place on a metaphorical camp. rap genius states that the first four tracks (""outside"", ""fire fly"", ""bonfire"" and ""all the shine"") are a representation of his childhood, rise to success, rise to fame and realisation that it's not all that it is cracked up to be the boy mentions that he finds his dad in the parking lot and he goes back home, but at the end of the monologue he states that he still hasn't got off the bus. maybe he did get off the bus at that point, but maybe there is something that stayed behind on the bus also, remember how he learned to cut out the middle man? instagram"

the boulevard of broken dreams
where gigolo and gigalette
can take a kiss without regret
so they forget their broken dreams
you laugh tonight and cry tomorrow
when you behold your shattered dreams
and gigolo and gigalette
awake to find their eyes are wet
with tears that tell of broken dreams
here is where you'll always find me
always walking up and down
but i left my soul behind me
in an old cathedral town
the joy that you find here you borrow
you cannot keep it long it seems
but gigolo and gigalette
still sing a song and dance along
boulevard of broken dreams"

a peaceful sky, there are such things
a rainbow high where heaven sings
so have a little faith and trust in what tomorrow brings
you'll reach a star because there are such things

where anyone at all from shirley temple to aimee semple
is equally understood
go out and try your luck, you might be donald duck

that phoney super-coney hollywood
they come from chillicothes and paducas with their bazookas
to get their names up in lights
all armed with photos from local rotos
with their hair in ribbon and legs in tights

413,n.y.c.,easy mo bee,Jazz,"chorus (kool g. rap)
n.y. city, crime around me, drug dynasties
death and robberies 
on the dark blocks where bodies bleed
jake inside the p.j.'s, the heat waves
kids play where heat sprays
straight floods, no love, fake thugs
draw blood with four-four snubs
tear away your rug
kids with clout 
up in the range rover with chicks, spray in their mouth
drain 'em out, set up for the wet up, bang 'em out
these streets in queens remain the murder scene, blood stain 'em out
(repeat)

verse 1: (kool g. rap)
inside the chambers of hell
where all the l puffin' niggas dwell
and fell 'cause of a loss of blood cells
bullet shells, glass is shattered
shit gets torn and tattered
niggas brains is splattered on sewage drains when they be goin' at it
static over addicts, revolvers and automatics 
it's illmatic how i seen one catch two in the cabbage
from an initial, official shiny nickel played pistols
sparklin' like crystals, launchin' missiles
domes get blown like whistles
ain't no jokin', niggas will leave you and your momma soakin'
and smokin' and blown open
bodies found in hoboken
kids comittin' murder after murder
shit is real so i feel for the ones that don't pack steel and burners
bodies be droppin' down around queens 
by different teams, it's the teens that tear your ass out the frame by
the seams
the end of the drama center, niggas you want drama?
word to momma come equipped with two clips and body armor. 

chorus 
verse 2: (jinx da juvy)
yeah, it's that young fella, jinx da juvy
fly lil' nigga, iced out with a fresh brand new coogi
jigged out, wig spinned out with waves
pockets full of the franklins, i stay gettin' paid
stay stackin' papes, plus my fam flip cakes
while some of us rap, other fellas flip 'caine
rock big chains, what ya'll think this a game?
murder incorp. slash open cases with cartels
we do things that make the mob tell
the way we go outta state and flip more cakes then carvel
ya'll play the cut, and watch this lil' nigga prevail
'cause i spit much hotter than hell
so why ya'll playa hate and plot to creep on mine
i pay ya'll no mind, but violate and speak to the nine
i'm a b.k. son of a gun 
when i spit 16 bars ya'll rap niggas dial 911
i'm only 14, and ya'll rap dudes ready to run
this ain't a game, ain't no time for fun
i'm the young rap lord, so i gotta hold it down
it's easy mo bee, g. rap and jinx da juvenile. 

verse 3: (kool g. rap)
crushed with the ice, get rushed for your life
busted in twice, stuck with a knife
on these rough nights we hustle and heist
put heaters to your man and double the price
snuffin' your lights, shake you like a couple of dice
nothin' is nice, prepare for combat
firearm cats with long gats, end up where you get embalmed at
lay on the floor flat, pull the gat format
direct beside your door mat 
cock the fours back, blow out your whore's back
leave the kids wigs tore back
my niggas ride with me like horseback
go to war rats, niggas you strapped? let me take that 
g. rap face slap all of these fake cats
and unofficials, get gun missiles clapped in your lung tissue
me and my dun's'll hit you, slugs not even one'll miss you
tons of pistols 
kid, you got guns?, you should've brung 'em wit' you
them niggas runnin' wit' you
caught 'em and hung 'em wit' you

at close range, have all you niggas lookin' for rogaine.

of something that never happened, yet you recall it well

that was laura but she's only a dream"

423,you don't know what love is,andy fusco,Jazz,"you don't know what love is
'til you've learned the meaning of the blues
until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
you don't know what love  is.

you don't know how lips hurt
until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
you don't know what love is.

do you know how a lost heart fears
at the thought of reminiscing,
and how lips that taste of tears
lose their taste for kissing?
you don't know how hearts burn
for love that can, not live yet never dies.
until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
you don't know what love is."
424,everything happens to me,bill evans,Jazz,"black cats creep across my path

i try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
i guess i'll go through life 
just catchin' colds and missin' trains

everything happens to me
i never miss a thing
i've had the measles and the mumps
and every time i play an ace
my partner always trumps
guess i'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

everything happens to me
at first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
that love would turn the trick to end despair
but know i just can't fool this head that thinks for me
i've mortgaged all my castles in the air
i've telegraphed and phoned
i send an ""airmail special"" too
your answer was ""goodbye""
and there was even postage due
i fell in love just once
and then it had to be with you

everything happens to me"

431,volare [#],oscar peterson,Jazz,"sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
and in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
but you and i have our love always there to remind us
there is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
volare, oh, oh! cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
we can sing in the glow of a star that i know of
where lovers enjoy peace of mind
let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

your love has given me wings
your love has given me wings"

low down, down around a spot that's hot!

i've got no peace
i'm losin' my lease on livin'
here's the how?
i'm tellin' you now to give in!

oh, make 'em play that crazy thing again

that dancin' demon has my feet in a trance,

i go into that dance

and once you hear the haunting strain to it,
i'd like to bet you'll go insane to it.

i let you
we broke the ties that bind
i wanted to forget you
and leave the past behind

seems to stay forever in my mind

the sky was blue
and high above
the moon was new
and so was love
this eager heart of mine was singing
lover where can you be

you came at last
love had its day
that day is past
you've gone away
this aching heart of mine is singing
lover come back to me
when i remember every little thing

you used to do
i'm so lonely
every road i walk along
i walk along with you
no wonder i am lonely

the sky is blue
the night is cold
the moon is new
but love is old
and while i'm waiting here
this heart of mine is singing
lover come back to me
when i remember every little thing

you used to do
i grow lonely
every road i walk along
i walk along with you
no wonder i am lonely

tell me you agree,
i was meant for you,
you were meant for me.

dearly beloved, how clearly i see,
somewhere in heaven you were fashioned for me,
angel eyes knew you,
angel voices led me to you;

nothing could save me,
fate gave me a sign;
i know that i'll be yours come shower or shine;
so i say merely,
dearly beloved be mine.

435,if i could be with you (one hour tonight),mark murphy,Jazz,"finally found a fella
almost completely divine
but his vocabulary
is killin' this romance of mine

and then begins this romeo's conversation

he says, ""murder,"" he says
ev'ry time we kiss

at a time like this
he says, ""murder,"" he says
is that the language of love?

he says, ""solid,"" he says
takes me in his arms
and says, ""solid,"" he says
meanin' all my charms
he says, ""solid,"" he says
is that the language of love?

he says, ""chick, chick, you torture me
zoot! are we livin'?""
i'm thinkin' o' leavin' him flat
he says, ""dig, dig, the jumps the old
ticker is givin'""
now, he can talk plainer than that

he says, ""murder,""' he says
ev'ry time we kiss
he says, ""murder,"" he says
keep it up like this
and that's, ""murder,"" he says
in that impossible tone
it will bring on nobody's murder but his own

he says, ""jackson,"" he says
and my name's marie
he says, ""jackson,"" he says
'shoot the snoot to me'

he says, ""hep, hep, with helium
now babe, we're cookin'""

he says, ""we're in da groove
and da groove is good lookin'""
he sounds like his uppers don't fit

that it'll be nobody else's murder but his own"
436,time alone will tell,ella fitzgerald,Jazz,"time alone will tell 
if our romance is real
or just a springtime spell
for heaven knows and time will tell

though i know so well
what we believe is love
may just turn out to be
a memory, but time will tell

do we really care
or do we share a fool's imagination?
nights will hurry by
then you will know, and so will i

when spring has had its fling
if you are in my arms
we'll know it's not a spell
we'll know it's real, but time will tell

when spring has had its fling
if you are in my arms
we'll know it's not a spell

you make me feel as though spring has sprung
and every time i see you grin
i'm such a happy in-div-dual

the moment that you speak 
i wanna go play hide and seek
i wanna go and bounce the moon
just like a toy balloon

you and i are just like a couple of tots 
runnin' across the meadow 
pickin' up lots of forget me nots

you make me feel so young 
you make me feel there are songs to be sung bells to be rung 
and a wonderful spring to be sprung
and even when i'm old and gray 
i'm gonna feel the way i do today
'cos you make me feel so young"
438,the rock and roll waltz,kay starr,Jazz,"one night i was late, came home from a date
slipped out of my shoes at the door
then from the front room, i heard a jump tune
i looked in and here's what i saw

there in the night was a wonderful scene
mom was dancing with dad to my record machine
and while they danced, only one thing was wrong
they were trying to waltz to a rock and roll song

a-one, two, and then rock
a-one, two, and then roll
they did the rock and roll waltz
a-rock, two, three, a-roll, two, three
it looked so cute to me
i love the rock and roll waltz

a-one, two, and then rock
a-one, two, and then roll
a-one, two, and then jump
it's good for your soul
it's old but it's new
let's do the rock and roll waltz

there in the night was a wonderful scene
mom was dancing with dad to my record machine

440,i concentrate on you,antonio carlos jobim,Jazz,"whenever skies look gray to me 
and trouble begins to brew
whenever the winter winds become too strong
i concentrate on you

when fortune cries ""nay, nay"" to me
people declare ""you're through""
whenever the blues become my only songs
i concentrate on you

on your smile, so sweet, so tender
when at first my kiss you do decline
on the light in your eyes when you surrender
and once again our arms intertwine

and so when wise men say to me
that love's young dream never comes true
to prove that even the wise men can be wrong
i concentrate on you"
441,lost in meditation,ella fitzgerald,Jazz,"i am lost in meditation
and my reverie
brings you back to me
for, in my imagination
love has lingered on
as though you'd never gone

this is just a dream that can not last
when the magic of this mood has passed
so, i sit in meditation
trying to pretend, this mood will never end

lost in meditation
and my reverie
brings you back to me"

he asked my name i held my breath
i couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings

'til you've learned the meaning of the blues
until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
you don't know what love  is.

you don't know how lips hurt
until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
you don't know what love is.

do you know how a lost heart fears
at the thought of reminiscing,
and how lips that taste of tears
lose their taste for kissing?
you don't know how hearts burn
for love that can, not live yet never dies.
until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
you don't know what love is."
457,closer to your love,al jarreau,Jazz,"there are those who fly
from the highest heights
on the wings they carry-
searching for the high
they can never find-
thinking love is blind.
never mind.
they'll never see
the forest for the trees
'til they turn to love.

crying through the eyes
of my own disguise-
came to know the truth
from the lies.
so,i hope you'll understand how
i'm another kind of man now.
all i want is just to stand
closer to your love.

[chorus]
don't wanna climb a mountain.
don't wanna swim a river.
i wanna feel the fire,power,
and all i can dream of.
don't wanna climb a mountain.
don't wanna swim a river.
i wanna move in
closer to your love.

if you try to fly
from the highest heights
on the wings you carry-
searching for the high
of your own design,
you may come to find
you been blind.

so i hope you'll understand how
i'm another kind of man now.
all i want is just to stand
a little closer to your love."

though i'm pretending
that i don't care
to be with you, my darling, is my prayer

i can't give up my pride

let's do it, let's fall in love"
461,the more i see you,john pizzarelli,Jazz,"each time i look at you is like the first time
each time you're near me the thrill is new
and there is nothing that i wouldn't do for
the rare delight of the sight of you for

the more i see you, the more i want you
somehow this feeling just grows and grows
with every sigh i become more mad about you
more lost without you and so it goes

can you imagine how much i love you?
the more i see you as years go by
i know the only one for me can only be you
my arms won't free you, my heart won't try

i know the only one for me can only be you
my arms won't free you, my heart won't try"
462,these foolish things,hampton hawes,Jazz,"oh! will you never let me be?
oh! will you never set me free?
the ties that bound us
are still around us
there's no escape that i can see
and still those little things remain
that bring me happiness or pain

a cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
an airline ticket to romantic places
and still my heart has wings
these foolish things remind me of you
a tinkling piano in the next apartment
those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
a fair ground's painted swings
these foolish things remind me of you
you came you saw you conquer'd me
when you did that to me
i knew somehow this had to be
the winds of march that make my heart a dancer
a telephone that rings but who's to answer?
oh, how the ghost of you clings!
these foolish things remind me of you

first daffodils and long excited cables
and candle lights on little corner tables
and still my heart has wings
these foolish things remind me of you
the park at evening when the bell has sounded
the ""ile de france"" with all the gulls around it
the beauty that is spring's
these foolish things remind me of you
how strange how sweet to find you still
these things are dear to me
they seem to bring you near to me
the sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
oh, how the ghost of you clings!
these foolish things remind me of you

gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
and still my heart has wings
these foolish things remind me of you
the smile of garbo and the scent of roses
the waiters whistling as the last bar closes
the song that crosby sings
these foolish things remind me of you
how strange how sweet to find you still
these things are dear to me
they seem to bring you near to me
the scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
oh, how the ghost of you clings!
these foolish things remind me of you"
463,i must have been a fool,al jarreau,Jazz,"i can tell by the look in your eyes theres no deceivin', theres no disguise what you need is a what you want you hide behind what you put up front so we find ourselves together im the only one to blame what i thought would last forever just another part of your game i must have been a fool i must have broke some rule now im losing you to the wind so im all alone with my yesterday, once again im back to the bottom line sometimes love can make or break you can build you up or shake you down if its real you dont need to fake it if its not no need to hang around if youre with me for a reason the time has come to let me know coz it seems your heart is freezin but you still dont wanna let me go and you say no more rainy days (so you say) go your way and you send me mine (go your way) too much too soon, was i too out of tune with your plans too much too soon, too out of tune with your plans i must have been a fool i must have broke some rule now im losing you to the wind so im all alone with my yesterday, once again im back to the bottom line"

465,how high the moon,louis prima,Jazz,"somewhere there's music
how faint the tune
somewhere there's heaven
how high the moon
there is no moon above
when love is far away too
till it comes true
that you love me as i love you

somewhere there's music
how near, how far
somewhere there's heaven
it's where you are
the darkest night would shine
if you would come to me soon
until you will, how still my heart
how high the moon

our hearts are made of it
let's take a chance
why be afraid of it?

let's close our eyes
and make our own paradise
little we know of it
still we can try
to make a go of it

we might have been meant for each other
to be or not to be, let our hearts discover

469,if you could see me now,doug raney,Jazz,"if you could see me now, you'd know how blue i've been
one look is all you'd need to see the mood i'm in.
perhaps then you'd realize i'm still in love with you.
if you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
and trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
but that's quite impossible, i'm still in love with you.
 
you'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
and the month will be may for a while.
i'll try to smile but can i play the part
without my heart behind the smile?
 
the way i feel for you i never could disguise
the look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
i think you'd be mine again if you could see me now."
470,on the sunny side of the street,ralph sutton,Jazz,"walked with no one and talked with no one
and i had nothing but shadows
then one morning you passed
and i brightened at last
now i greet the day and complete the day
with the sun in my heart
all my worry blew away
when you taught me how to say

grab your coat and get your hat
leave your worry on the doorstep
just direct your feet
to the sunny side of the street
can't you hear a pitter-pat?
and that happy tune is your step
life can be so sweet
on the sunny side of the street

i used to walk in the shade
with those blues on parade
but i'm not afraid
this rover crossed over

if i never have a cent
i'd be rich as rockefeller
gold dust at my feet
on the sunny side of the street
grab your street"

fill me with flaming desire
setting my being completely on fire
you and the night and the music

until the pale light of dawning and daylight 
our hearts will be throbbing guitars
morning may come without warning
and take away the stars

if we must live for the moment
love till the moment is through
after the night and the music die
will i have you

my hat?
oh bing, how nice of you to ask me that.
because there's a very interesting story 
connected with this hat, there really is.
i was walking down the street the other day,
ran into mllicent palmer, you know millicent palmer,
a very dear friend of mine.

how do i get involved?

well we walked around the corner for what passes
for a millinery shop and she looked in the window and
saw my hat and said, ""that is for you""
i went in, the saleslady put it on my head and i 
thought it was a little matronly 

time

oh, now wait, no wait

cut

when i got my arm around you and we're going for a walk
must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, talk, talk, talk

i'll politely close your lips with mine

how's your golf bing?

my golf? ho-ho i'm really moving that ball out there, striking it a ton.
i had a sixty-nine sunday, should have been a sixty-five.
terrific wind blowing, couldn't drop a single putt, it was murder

oh, i lost my head with this question

and of course the equipment, you just can't get any golf balls anymore
the actors are hoarding them all...and the caddies, huh they want an 
annuity for eighteen holes. you've got to take an option on one to be sure
he'll show up.

same line

you asked me about my hat,
you've been standing there for an hour

i thought
about golf

you didn't even let me finish my story
i told you what i would do

475,the song is you,anthony braxton,Jazz,"i hear music when i look at you,
a beautiful theme of every
dream i ever knew.
down deep in my heart i hear it play.
i feel it start, then melt away.

i hear music when i touch your hand,
a beautiful melody
from some enchanted land.
down deep in my heart, i hear it say,
is this the day?

i alone have heard this lovely strain,
i alone have heard this glad refrain:
must it be forever inside of me,
why can't i let it go,
why can't i let you know,
why can't i let you know the song
my heart would sing?

that beautiful rhapsody
of love and youth and spring,
the music is sweet,
the words are true 
the song is you."
476,you go to my head,steve tyrell,Jazz,"you go to my head
and you linger like a haunting refrain
and i find you spinning round in my brain
like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

you go to my head
like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
and i find the very mention of you
like the kicker in a julep or two

the thrill of the thought
that you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
still i say to myself get a hold of yourself
can't you see that it never can be?

you go to my head
with a smile that makes my temperature rise
like a summer with a thousand july's
you intoxicate my soul with your eyes

though i'm certain that this heart of mine
hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
you go to my head
you go to my head"

head first before the heart
ain't no shame
ain't no game
with the flame

coldwaters rush in march
no place for april flowers
take her name
say she came
with the flame

i've been told when the stars all align
that even bitter lips like mine
will call the moon a friend and kiss again
some i'm told let their hearts read the signs
while other men are hungerin'
and can't let it in

be still my foolish heart
please don't upset the cart
stay the same
ain't no game
with the flame

i've been told i'll be dancin in time
walkin' rhythm', talkin' rhyme
the earth will turn and send the sun again
all my gold for a light or a sign
some kind of kin to say my friend
let it out - let it in

strange fire down below
so 'fraid to let you know
change my name
start the game
with the flame

strange fire down below
so 'fraid to let you know
change my name
start again
with the flame
the flame 
the flame"
478,you are too beautiful,thelonious monk,Jazz,"you are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
and i am a fool for beauty
fooled by a feeling that because i have found you
i could have bound you too

you are too beautiful for one man alone
for one lucky fool to be with
when there are other men
with eyes of their own to see with

love does not stand sharing
not if one cares
have you been comparing
my every kiss with theirs

if, on the other hand, i'm faithful to you
it's not through a sense of duty
you are too beautiful
and i am a fool for beauty

love does not stand sharing
not if one cares
have you been comparing
my every kiss with theirs

it's not through a sense of duty
you are too beautiful
and i am a fool for beauty"
479,tenderly,dianne reeves,Jazz,"the evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly
the trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
then you and i came wandering by
and lost in a sigh were we

the shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly
i can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly
your arms opened wide and closed me inside
you took my lips
you took my love so tenderly

the shore was kissed (the shore was kissed)
by sea and mist (by sea and mist)
tenderly (tenderly)
oh i can't forget (i can't forget)
how two hearts met (how two hearts met)
breathlessly (breathlessly)

it was just one of those things, 
but don't ever bet me, 
""cause i'm gonna be true if you let me. 
you're gonna love me like nobody's loved me, 
come rain or come shine. 
happy together, unhappy together

481,lazy afternoon,freddie hubbard,Jazz,"ollie told me i'm a fool. 
so i walked on down the road a mile, 
went to the house that brings a smile
sat upon my grandpa's knee, 
and what do you think he said to me?

[chorus]
when you awake you will remember ev'rything, 
you will be hangin' on a string from your
when you believe, 
you will relieve the only soul
that you were born with to grow old and never know

ollie showed me the fork in the road.
you can take to the left or go straight to the right,
use your days and save your nights,
be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,
sleep with the light on and you got it beat.

[chorus]

ollie warned me it's a mean old world,
the street don't greet ya, yes, it's true;
but what am i supposed to do:
read the writing on the wall,
i heard it when i was very small.

[chorus]

wash my hand in lye water, 
i got a date with the captains daughter. 
you can go and tell your brother. 
we sure gonna love one another, oh! 
you may be right and ya might be wrong, 
i ain't gonna worry all day long.

snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite, 
my old car froze up last night. 
ain't no reason to hang your head 
i could wake up in the mornin' dead. 
oh! and if i thought it would do any good, 
i'd stand on the rock where moses stood."

i used to not need nothin'.
now trouble is all i need.

well, tessie loves excitement;
can make a dull moment a thrill.
she does whatever she wants,
then puts it on my bill.
but that ain't so expensive;
got it covered in my sleep.
see dawlin', i got you,
and baby, you're...

trouble.
trouble.
i used to not need nothin'
now trouble is all i need.

i wouldn't bet against myself
in a poker game,
or build a house
in a hurricane;
and lose everything i had.
and spend the rest of my life gone mad.
in a way it would be a relief.
it really wouldn't be so bad.
see dawlin', i got you, and baby, you're...

for you i sigh, for you dear only
why haven't you seen it
i'm all for you body and soul

i spend my days in longing
and wondering why it's me you're wronging
i tell you i mean it
i'm all for you body and soul

i can't believe it
it's hard to conceive it
that you'd turn away romance
are you pretending
it looks like the ending
unless i could have just one more chance to prove, dear

sweetheart, when you are not near

my disposition depends on you
i never mind the rain from the skies
if i can find the sun in your eyes
sometimes i love you, sometimes i hate you
but when i hate you, it's 'cause i love you
that's how i am, so what can i do?
i'm happy when i'm with you

stars are smiling at me from your eyes
sunbeams now there will be in the skies
tell me that you will be true
that will all depend on you

488,polka dots and moonbeams,oscar peterson,Jazz,"a country dance was being held in a garden
i felt a bump and heard an ""oh, beg your pardon""
suddenly i saw polka dots and moonbeams
all around a pug-nosed dream

the music started and was i the perplexed one
i held my breath and said ""may i have the next one?""
in my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

there were questions in the eyes of other dancers
as we floated over the floor
there were questions but my heart knew all the answers
and perhaps a few things more

now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
i know the meaning of the words ""ever after""
and i'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
when i kiss the pug-nosed dream"

and then there suddenly appeared before me
the only one my arms will ever hold
i heard somebody whisper ""please adore me""
and when i looked, the moon had turned to gold!
blue moon! 
now i'm no longer alone
without a dream in my heart
without a love of my own"

my poor old heart it ain't gaining any ground
because my angel eyes ain't here
angel eyes, the old devil sent
they glow unbearably bright
and need i say that my love's misspent
misspent with angel eyes tonight
go ahead and drink up all of you people
order anything you see

until the morning light. 
autumn 
i see colours fading out 
the heat is cooling down 
and leaves are falling to the ground. 
as in winter 
were out of what we had 
we looking for excuses 
but our love is simply dead 

but it is cold so cold 
and clouds burry us like snow. 
we were so bold to hold 
on to love like gold. 
and it's so beautiful 
when ever nature does her thing; 
oh it's so beautiful 
just like a queen and a king. 
and the rain yes the rain 
couldn't wash away my blame, 
yes the rain ah the rain 
couldn't wash away my blame

and we are in it 
some wait for miracles 
we push the limits. 
through ups and downs, 
hills and valleys 
i have traveled 
and i'm far from finished. 
i keep it moving , 
keep it spinning, 
see i wouldn't be me today 
if it wasn't for the shit i've been in. 
can't be losing ever winning 
don't get caught up in winter take it back to the beginning

love is a spark lost in the dark,
too soon, too soon,
i feel wherever i go
that tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
and always too soon.

time is so old and love so brief,
love is pure gold and time a thief.

speak love to me and soon."

a foggy day, in london town
had me low, had me down
i viewed the morning, with much alarm

can't you see that it never can be?

you go to my head
with a smile that makes my temperature rise

in the silence of my lonely room
i think of you
night and day

night and day

and its torment won't be through
'til you let me spend my life

she woke up at dawn
kissed her little baby,
then she'd yawn
she'd go to work and
school, so tired she'd feel

once upon a time she was
so full of hope
she maintained walkin'
on a tight rope
then a decade passed,
things stayed the same
her mind went missin',
just her body remained.
her soul went runnin'
to find out if she'd been misplaced
how could i be lost
stop the world let me get off
no peace could she find
the devil kept messin' with her mind
the girl was so tough, but
one day she had enough
pardon the miss, she's gotta
right to have a
nervous breakdown
her baby's daddy left
she still got on fine
she fell in love again
but lost one more time
woe to the day her heart began to decay
she tried to fight
but then her will ran away
to lose a dream
is very hard to live with
looked in the lost and found
could not find it
blessed be the child
god gave her, who wipes her tears
lovin' the mother
who's loved him all his years
but she was drownin'
and could not come
in from out there

no peace could she find
the devil kept messin' with her mind
the girl was so tough, but
one day she had enough
pardon the miss, she's gotta
right to have a
nervous breakdown
balancing one minute
then her rope got too thin
searchin' for solid ground
to turn her life around

how do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? that didn't last
with bits of memories scattered here and there
i look around and don't know where to start

which books are yours?
which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
so many habits that we'll have to break
and yesterday's we'll have to take apart

one day there'll be a song or something in the air again
to catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
a moment in what might have been

where do you start? do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? i guess you try
and though i don't know where and don't know when
i'll find myself in love again
i promise there will always be a little place no one will see
a tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you"
519,love is real,al jarreau,Jazz,"you think that love
is just a fairy tale
maybe true love is sold
and bought
hansel and gretel found
their candy getting stale
and you're gonna find
you ain't no goldilocks

when those bells just
keep on ringing
and that song you're singing
and you want to share
your mondays-
right through to sundays
your best friend is softly speakin'
she won't call this weekend
no way-it's only a fling you say
but

[chorus]
love is real, yes it is girl
never let anyone
tell you different
when you can feel it
love is real, yes it is mama
never let anyone
tell you different
when you can feel this
feeling's for real

let me tell you something
don't go away
don't you stray
let me tell you something
don't go away
don't you stray

you think that love's
what's on that silver screen
raquel and redford are the tops
you've been misled
by all those movies you've seen
love ain't a robber
hidin' from the cops

when you toss 'n' turn all morning
and you wake up yawning
and you walk that floor all evening
and you should be leaving
and you find yourself pretending
you've got a happy ending-
no way-it's only a fling you say
but

[chorus: x3]"
520,it might as well be spring,ella fitzgerald,Jazz,"i'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm, i'm as jumpy as puppet on a string
i'd say that i had spring fever, but i know it isn't spring
i am starry eyed and vaguely discontented, like a nightingale without a song to sing
o why should i have spring fever, when it isn't even spring 

i keep wishing i were someone else, walking down a strange new street
and hearing words that i've never heard from a girl i've yet to meet
i'm as busy as spider spinning daydreams, spinning spinning daydreams
i'm as giddy as a baby on a swing 

i haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud, or a robin on the wing
but i feel so gay in a melancholy way, that it might as well be spring
it might as well be spring."
521,"cry, baby, cry",judy garland,Jazz,"cry, baby, cry, cry, baby cry,
just the way i did the day you broke my heart
cry, baby, cry, you flew too high
tables turned and now you've learned you're not so smart
you broke every promise
you couldn't be true
you gave me the go-by
for somebody new when i needed you
cry, baby, cry. my eyes are dry.
i'm laughin' up my sleeve to see my cry baby cry."
522,"just you, just me",ruby braff,Jazz,"just you, just me

use your imagination!
just you, just me
i'll tie a lover's knot
'round wonderful you!"

524,you go to my head,gene krupa,Jazz,"you go to my head
and you linger like a haunting refrain
and i find you spinning round in my brain
like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

you go to my head
like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
and i find the very mention of you
like the kicker in a julep or two

the thrill of the thought
that you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
still i say to myself get a hold of yourself
can't you see that it never can be?

you go to my head
with a smile that makes my temperature rise
like a summer with a thousand july's
you intoxicate my soul with your eyes

though i'm certain that this heart of mine
hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
you go to my head
you go to my head"
525,poinciana,bing-crosby,Jazz,"poinciana, your branches speak to me of love,
pale moon is casting shadows from above.
poinciana, somehow i feel the jungle heat,
within me there grows a rhythmic savage beat.
love is everywhere, its magic perfume fills the air,
to and fro you sway, my heart's in time, i've learned to care.
poinciana, though skies may turn from blue to gray,
my love will live forever and a day."
526,will you love me tomorrow,dianne reeves,Jazz,"tonight you're mine, completely
you give your soul so sweetly
tonight the light of love is in your eyes
but will you love me tomorrow

is this a lasting treasure
or just a moment's pleasure
can i believe the magic in your sighs
and will you still love me tomorrow

tonight with words unspoken
you say that i'm the only one
but will my heart be broken
when the night meets the morning sun

i'd like to know if your love
is a love i can be sure of
so tell me now and i won't ask again
will you still love me tomorrow
will you still love me tomorrow
will you still love me tomorrow"

the street in the dead of night

a world away beneath the sun 
the earth goes dry 
a hungry starving people search 
for food as their babies die

i tell you, we can touch the world 
when we meet them all at their need 
we can touch them where they are 
help them to believe, touch the world 

he's on the pipe and he's got the shakes 
as he takes a puff 
their badges shine and there's no escape 
as they lock him up 

fourteen years old and without love 
the girl is livin' wild 
how can it be a four month pregnancy 
and she's the child 

(chorus) 
i tell you, we can touch the world 
when we meet them all at their need 
we can touch them where they are 
help them to believe, touch the world 

round the globe people need to know 
the answer's theirs today, 
someway 
somehow 

we must let them know that god 
gives hope and jesus is the way"
528,out in the cold,george howard,Jazz,"i only wanted to play
i thought what he didn't know wouldn't hurt him anyway
but he found out and someone else gave him her hand to hold
and suddenly i find myself out in the cold

he trusted me all the time
i thought i could see another man and he would still be mine
well yesterday i had a good thing worth more than gold
today he's got a truer love and i'm out in the cold

i had a love warmer than fire
but i listened to my desire
now yesterday's dreams are tomorrow's heart aches
i'm payin' for my mistakes
now girl, take a tip from one who knows
if you open up a new door, you may find the old one's closed

so be true to your good man 
take a lesson from the story i have told
or you just might get-a left now out in the cold
you just might get-a left now out in the cold

don't let yourself get left now out in the cold
don't let yourself get left now out in the cold

530,hang on little tomato,pink martini,Jazz,"the sun has left and forgotten me
it's dark, i cannot see
why does this rain pour down
i'm gonna drown
in a sea
of deep confusion

somebody told me, i don't know who
whenever you are sad and blue
and you're feelin' all alone and left behind
just take a look inside and you will find

you gotta hold on, hold on through the night
hang on, things will be all right
even when it's dark
and not a bit of sparkling
sing-song sunshine from above
spreading rays of sunny love

just hang on, hang on to the vine
stay on, soon you'll be divine
if you start to cry, look up to the sky
something's coming up ahead
to turn your tears to dew instead

and so i hold on to his advice
when change is hard and not so nice
you listen to your heart the whole night through
your sunny someday will come one day soon to you"

and he taught her how to love the american way
to love with her soul t'was easy to learn

i met a woman, we started talking
i took her home, to get a few nips
but all i had was a mint julep

i don't remember just how i started
i only know that we should have parted
i stole a kiss, and then another
i didn't mean to take it further

one mint julep was the cause of it all
the lights were burning low, there in the parlor
when through the kitchen door, up popped her father
he said ""i saw you when you kissed my daughter
better wed her right now, or face a slaughter!""

i didn't know just what i was doing
i had to marry of face ruin

a mint julep, a mint julep
a mint julep, a mint julep
one mint julep was the cause of it all

now, i don't want to bore you with my troubles
but from now on i?ll be thinking double
i'm through with flirting and drinking whiskey
i got six extra children from a-getting frisky

a mint julep, a mint julep
one mint julep was the cause of it all"

dream, that's the thing to do
just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
you'll find your share of memories there

so dream when the day is through
dream, and they might come true
things never are as bad as they seem
so dream, dream, dream

things never are as bad as they seem
so dream, dream, dream, dream

549,when lights are low,archie shepp,Jazz,"listen to the melody entrancing
blending in a soft and sweet refrain
as around the floor, dear, we are dancing
swaying to a fascinating strain
 
sweet music soft and mellow
soothing and slow
strains of a mellow 'cello
when lights are low 
dear, we're so close together i love you so 
why think about the weather 
when lights are low 
two hearts revealing
music hath charms 
life's so appealing
with inspiration, in your arms 
our lips meeting soft and tender 
love's all aglow 
why shouldn't we surrender 
when lights are low
 
listen how happy hearts are beating
like the ocean beats upon the sand
and our feet in rhythm keep repeating
ev'ry little movement of the band
 
sweet music soft and mellow
soothing and slow
strains of a mellow 'cello
when lights are low 
dear, we're so close together i love you so 
why think about the weather 
when lights are low
two hearts revealing
music hath charms
life's so appealing
with inspiration, in your arms 
our lips meeting soft and tender 
love's all aglow 
why shouldn't we surrender

550,you go to my head,dave stryker,Jazz,"you go to my head
and you linger like a haunting refrain
and i find you spinning round in my brain
like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

you go to my head
like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
and i find the very mention of you
like the kicker in a julep or two

the thrill of the thought
that you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
still i say to myself get a hold of yourself
can't you see that it never can be?

you go to my head
with a smile that makes my temperature rise
like a summer with a thousand july's
you intoxicate my soul with your eyes

though i'm certain that this heart of mine
hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
you go to my head
you go to my head"
551,do you know what it means to miss new orleans,"connick, jr., harry",Jazz,"do you know what it means to miss new orleans
and miss her each night and day
i know i'm not wrong because the feeling's
getting stronger the longer i stay away
miss the moss-covered vines
tall sugar pines
where mockingbirds used to sing
i'd love to see that old lazy mississippi
running in the spring
moonlight on the bayous
creole tunes fill the air
i dream about magnolias in june
and i'm wishin i was there
do you know what it means to miss new orleans
when that's where you left your heart
and there's one thing more
i miss the one i care for
more than i miss new orleans"

he was a kind man,
helping a fellow along,

one could not walk,

when you're laughing, when you're laughing,
the sun comes shining through,
but when you're crying you bring on the rain,
so stop your sighing be happy again,

the whole world smiles with you.

that brings a day so gently
and bathes the leaves
of memories
that fell so long ago

in all these early hours
though i were there
once more to share
a love lost long ago

concluding only half of the truth
exuding only one small percent
of what i surely felt for you

and then one morning
that brought a day so gently
we set apart
things of the heart
and lost love long ago"

the best of you and the best of me

what happens next?

because i can't wait to see what happens next
what happens next?
you'll see.

no i'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

my knapsack on my back.

val-deri,
val-dera-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
val-deri,val-dera.
my knapsack on my back.

i love to wander by the stream
that dances in the sun,
so joyously it calls to me,
""come! join my happy song!""

i wave my hat to all i meet,
and they wave back to me,
and blackbirds call so loud and sweet
from ev'ry green wood tree.

high overhead, the skylarks wing,
they never rest at home
but just like me, they love to sing,
as o'er the world we roam.

until the day i die!
oh, may i always laugh and sing,
beneath god's clear blue sky!"

so darn persistent,
the day isn't distant
when it'll drive me insane.
comes in the morning
without any warning,
and hangs around me all day.
i'll have to sneak up to it
someday, and speak up to it.
i hope it listens when i say:

fascinating rhythm,
you've got me on the go!
fascinating rhythm,
i'm all a-quiver.

what a mess you're making!
the neighbors want to know
why i'm always shaking
just like a flivver.

each morning i get up with the sun 
start a-hopping,
never stopping 
to find at night no work has been done.

i know that
once it didn't matter 
but now you're doing wrong;
when you start to patter
i'm so unhappy.

won't you take a day off?
decide to run along
somewhere far away off 
and make it snappy!

oh, how i long to be the man i used to be!
fascinating rhythm,
on won't you stop picking on me?"

with nothing to do
but to live in dreams that i make up

i picture the prettiest stories
only to wake up
all by myself

what is the good of me by myself?

why was i born
why am i living
what do i get
what am i giving

why do i want a thing
i daren't hope for
what can i hope for
i wish i knew

why do i try
to draw you near me
why do i do i cry
you never hear me

why delay 
don't go away 
simply call it a day 

pleading moments we knew 
i will set them apart 
ev'ry word, ev'ry sign 
will be burned in my heart 
but no tears will be shed 
there'll be no one to blame 
let it always be said 
we attempted what came 

no, no regrets

how far is the journey
from here to a star?

to think i'll find another dream
(or to think i'll never find a dream)
in my life till i look around and see,
this great big world is part of me and my life

this is my life
today, tomorrow, love will come and find me

this is my life
and i don't give a damn for lost emotions
i've such a lot of love i've got to give

sometime when i feel afraid,
i think of what a mess i've made of my life
crying over my mistakes,
forgetting all the breaks i've had in my life
i was put on earth to be,
a part of this great world is me
and my life
guess i'll just have to score,
and count the things i'm grateful for in my life

this is my life

one day we'll meet
and you'll dry all my tears

it's the good life 
to be free and explore the unknown
like the heartaches 
when you learn you must face them alone

please, remember, i still love you
and in case you don't know
well, just wake up
kiss the good life ""hello"""

one can betray one's troubles never, whatever occurs!

have to be bright,
whether you're well or ill;
the people have to laugh their fill,
you mustn't sleep till dawn comes creeping.

though i never really grumble,
life's a jumble indeed!
and in my efforts to succeed
i've had to formulate a creed.

i believe in doing what i can,
in crying when i must
and laughing when i choose.
heigh ho!
if love were all i should be lonely!

i believe the more you love a man,
the more you give your trust,
the more you're bound to lose;
although, when shadows fall i think if only
somebody splendid really needed me,
somebody affectionate and dear,
cares would be ended
if i knew that he wanted to have me near.

but i believe that, since my life began,
the most i've had is just a talent to amuse,
heigh ho!
if love were all!

you came, you saw, you conquered me
when you did that to me
i knew somehow this had to be

the winds of march that made my heart a dancer
a telephone that rings but who's to answer

these foolish things remind me of you

how strange, how sweet to find you still

from now on this is my world
yes we lost but i don't hurt any more
i knew there must be more to life than this
now is the time for me
i'm grateful you set me free
baby one good turn deserves another
now is the time for you
pray our dreams come true
could not see the world around me
you were my world
but now i keep inside my heart a
there is no need to worry
i'll find my place in the sun
better days are here to stay forever
times are changing so am i
not alone 'cause there's a heart needing love
i know that god will give me one more chance
everything seems new
have to get to know my friends again
i never realized that it could be like this
time is a love-continuum
and i've got so much love to give
i'm not afraid to start this journey again tomorrow"
615,you don't know what love is,jacqui naylor,Jazz,"you don't know what love is
'til you've learned the meaning of the blues
until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
you don't know what love  is.

you don't know how lips hurt
until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
you don't know what love is.

do you know how a lost heart fears
at the thought of reminiscing,
and how lips that taste of tears
lose their taste for kissing?
you don't know how hearts burn
for love that can, not live yet never dies.
until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
you don't know what love is."
616,the song is you,ryan kisor,Jazz,"i hear music when i look at you,
a beautiful theme of every
dream i ever knew.
down deep in my heart i hear it play.
i feel it start, then melt away.

i hear music when i touch your hand,
a beautiful melody
from some enchanted land.
down deep in my heart, i hear it say,
is this the day?

i alone have heard this lovely strain,
i alone have heard this glad refrain:
must it be forever inside of me,
why can't i let it go,
why can't i let you know,
why can't i let you know the song
my heart would sing?

that beautiful rhapsody
of love and youth and spring,
the music is sweet,
the words are true 
the song is you."
617,careless love,"willis ""gator"" jackson",Jazz,"love, oh love, oh careless love
you've fly through my head like wine
you've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
and you nearly spoiled this life of mine

love, oh love, oh careless love
in your clutches of desire
you've made me break a many true vow
then you set my very soul on fire

love, oh love, oh careless love
all my happiness bereft
you've filled my heart with weary old blues
now i'm walkin', talkin' to myself

love, oh love, oh careless love
trusted you now, it's too late
you've made me throw my old friend down
that's why i sing this song of hate

love, oh love, oh careless love
night and day, i weep and moan
you brought the wrong man into this life of mine
for my sins, till judgment i'll atone"
618,my future just passed,kay starr,Jazz,"there goes the girl i dreamed all through school about, 
there goes the girl i'll now be a fool about 
ring down the curtain, i'm certain at present 
my future just passed. 

don't even know if she has been spoken for. 
if she is tied, the ties must be broken, for 
life can't be that way,to wake me then break me 
my future just passed. 

stars in the blue, tho' you're at a distance 
you can at least do this, 
sometimes a boy encounters resistance 
help me to win this miss. 

here are my arms, may she find illusion there. 
look in my heart, there is no confusion there 
now that i'm loving, i'm living at last, 
my future just passed"
619,muskrat ramble,"harry connick, jr.",Jazz,"i look at them shuffle and the shuffle come down
ramblin' and scramblin' and a-headin' for town
hoppin' and boppin' and a-buzzin' around
happily awaitin' at the station
i look at that train number 709
hoppin' and boppin' and arrivin' on time
who do you think is about to arrive
the band they call the dixieland five

they're gonna play that muskrat ramble tune
like the way you never heard it played
get ready for the big parade
all together now - one and two
join that happy crowd
tellin' me that ramblin' scramblin' muskrat song
come on, ramble along
yeah"
620,i concentrate on you,patricia barber,Jazz,"whenever skies look gray to me
and troubles begin to brew
whenever the winter winds become too strong
i concentrate on you

when fortune cries nay, nay to me
and people declare we're through
whenever the blues become my only song
i concentrate on you

on your smile so sweet, so tender
when at first my kiss you decline
oh, the light in your eyes when you surrender
and once again our arms intertwine

and so when wise men say to me
that love's young dreams never come true
to prove that even wise men can be wrong
i concentrate on you

your smile so sweet, so tender
when at first my kiss you decline
oh, the light in your eyes when you surrender
and once again our arms intertwine

and so when wise men say to me
that love's young dreams never come true
to prove that even wise men can be wrong
i concentrate on you
i concentrate and concentrate on you"

622,so many stars,sarah vaughan,Jazz,"the dark is filled with dreams
so many dreams, which one is mine?
one must be right for me

which dream of all the dreams
when there's a dream for every star
and there are oh so many stars, so many stars

the wind is filled with songs
so many songs, which one is mine?
one must be right for me

which song of all the songs
when there's a song for every star
and there are oh so many stars, so many stars

along the countless days, the endless nights
that i have searched so many eyes
so many hearts, so many smiles

which one to choose, which way to go?
how can i tell, how will i know out of
oh, so many stars, so many stars?

along the countless days, the endless nights
that i have searched so many eyes

so many stars, so many stars, so many stars"
623,never no more,souls of mischief,Jazz,"intro/chorus:

never no more, never no more
never will a sucka score, never no more
never no more, never no more
never will a sucka score, never no more

[tajai]

message recorded, lessons be stored in
this mental core it's, like lentil porridge
nas-t, massey, be the last g
from medical texts to class me
ask me, if i had to grip my pad
the riffs i grab would rip and stab
the kids that sag the shit they strap
is flavorless, and wreckless
your bestest behavior gets
i plays the hits, displays the shit
a razor gets parlayed amidst
and later splits a feeling that
i made ya hit, a really phat i gave to kids
when i punched em
i crunch men, at a function

[phesto]

ponder on this, i swallowed the spliff with elocution
encompassing the pompous means when i escalate my tool
shins get split, men get spindled swiveled pivoted
by my riveting centrifuge
i swindling crews, bringing a fist to bruise
pulverizing skulls annihilating trifling dunces
pulling rifle pumps to stifle punks when my knife splits
split your spleen hit you clean in the kisser
when i twist a riddle i'm breakin the brittle
and flimsy with my whimsy
puns and phrases i stun and phase kids
terrorize em paralyze em paraplegic, when i leave em
mindless spineless vertabraetless with menengitis
i earn em swift and minus a life with my nine

chorus 2x

[a-plus]

i get the props, you get the buttocks
i know my what nots, stoppin flows like blood claats
nah, 'cause that's a bad word in jamaican
and i am that, grams packed 'cause my jam's phat
so get the beaner butter we discovered treasure
you're sweet when i stomp you with my feet just for pleasure
'cause i write the rhymes like a slave'll pick the cotton
the best from the west 'cause i'm fresh and you're rotten
take out the trash or i'll take it out your ass
with a blast from the past in the future, i'll shoot ya
but for the present beatdowns will suffice
lose 'cause you choose to be down with some mice
you dumb dunces i come once it's my time to
want to hear a joke?  i'm you
don't you wish i won't dismiss your treachery
i bet you be, leaving upon a stretcher g

[opio]

i'm coming tighter, your rhymes are oreida
little reminiscent of the poetry i write
a-stoundingly, you're sounding like me, might we
step outside and settle this i cause catastrophes
i laugh at these cause my shit is astonishing
demolishing, you and your following i'm swallowing
mc's like i was a black hole ramsack those
wack flows who chose to oppose
i don't suppose, dare or where my stubble grows
reverses the process, god bless you swing and whoa it's you!
opio, disposes of crews like snotty tissues
i rip through bodies with corkscrews you wish you never tried

chorus 2x

never again"
624,i-love-you-porgy,billie-holiday,Jazz,"i love you, porgy

don't let him handle me
and drive me mad
if you can keep me
i want to stay here
with you forever
and i'll be glad
i love you, porgy
don't let him take me
don't let him handle me
with his hot hands
if you can keep me
i want to stay here
with you forever
i've got my man
someday i know he's coming
back to call me
he's gonna handle me
and hold me so
it's going to be like dying, porgy
when he calls me
but when he comes, i know
i'll have to go

625,with my eyes wide open i'm dreaming,patti page,Jazz,"with my eyes wide open i'm dreaming
can it be true i'm holding you close to my heart?
with my eyes wide open i'm dreaming
you're with me now sharing a vow never to part

i'm so afraid to close my eyes
afraid that i'll find
this lovely thrill
is just a silly illusion

with my eyes wide open i'm dreaming
do i deserve such a break?
pinch me to prove i'm awake
i can't believe that you're really mine

monologue: 
darlin' with my eyes wide open i'm dreamin' ! can it be true that i'm holdin'
you so close to my heart? ya know with my eyes wide open i'm dreamin' ! you're here with
me now make the vow that we'd never part. i'm so afraid to close my eyes! i'm afraid that i'll
wake and find that all this dreamin' is just a silly illusion!

with my eyes wide open i'm dreaming
do i deserve such a break?
pinch me to prove i'm awake
i can't believe that you're really mine"
626,heart and soul,kitty margolis,Jazz,"heart and soul

i fell in love with you heart and soul

because you held me tight

and stole a kiss in the night



heart and soul

i begged to be adored

i lost control and tumbled overboard gladly

that magic night we kissed

there in the moon mist

oh but your lips were thrilling, much to thrilling

never before were mine so faintly willing

but now i see what one embrace can do

that little kiss you stole

held all my heart and stole



now i see what one embrace can do

look at me it's got me loving you madly

that little kiss you stole

held all my heart and soul "
627,"just you, just me",bill coleman,Jazz,"just you, just me
let's find a cozy spot
to cuddle and coo
 
just us, just we
i've missed an awful lot
my trouble is you
 
oh, gee!
what are your charms for?
what are my arms for?
use your imagination!
just you, just me
i'll tie a lover's knot
'round wonderful you!"
628,for the love of you,hank crawford,Jazz,"hmm huh hoo hoo hey baby
i'm looking for you 
drifting on a memory 
ain't no place i'd rather be 
than with you, loving you 
day will make a way for night 
all we'll need is candlelight 
and a song soft and long, well 
glad to be here alone 
with a lover unlike no other 
safe to see a new horizon 
slowly coming into view 

i wanna be living for the love of you 
all that i'm giving is for the love of you 

lovely as a ray of sun 
that touches me when the morning comes 
feels good to me, my love and me 
smoother than a gentle breeze 
flowing through my mind with ease 
soft as can be well when you're loving me 
love to be riding the waves of your love 
enchanted with your touch it seems to me 
we can sail together in and out of mystery 

i wanna be living for the love of you 
all that i'm giving is for the love of you 

paradise i have within 
can't feel insecure again 
you're the key and this i see 
now and then i lose my way 
using words to try and say 
what i feel yeah love is real 
ooh i might as well 
sign my name on a card 
which could say it better 
time will tell 
'cause it seems that i've done 
just about all that i can do do do 

i wanna be living for the love of you 
all that i'm giving is for the love of you"
629,where or when,lionel hampton,Jazz,"it seems we stood and talked like this before
we looked at each other in the same way then
but i can't remember where or when

the clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
the smile you are smiling you were smiling then
but i can't remember where or when

some things that happened for the first time
seem to be happening again

and so it seems that we have met before
and laughed before, and loved before
but who knows where or when"
630,all in my mind [*],dakota staton,Jazz,"i think that you don't care
and it's more than i can bear
i don't know, baby
maybe its all in my mind, all in my mind

i know that i've been true
but honey, sweetie baby what about you?
i don't know, baby
maybe it's all in my mind

we've been going steady so long
i'd never dream you would ever do me wrong
i knew i was yours and i thought you were mine
and that every little thing was so fine

whoa, darling, i'd hate to see
someone else with you other than me
i don't know baby
maybe its all in my mind
all in mind, oh, uum, uum
oh yes, its all in my mind

i don't mean to think so mean and evil, baby
please tell me, tell me
it's all in my mind"
631,it's you or no one,hampton hawes,Jazz,"how did i know that the warmth of the glow would last.
how did i guess that the long loneliness was past.
i merely looked at you and i knew that i knew.

it's you or no one for me
i'm sure of this each time we kiss
now and forever and when forever's done
you'll find that you are still the one

please don't say no to my plea
'cause if you do then i'm all through
there's this about you
my world's an empty world without you
it's you or no one for me

please don't say no to my plea
'cause if you do then i'm all through
there's this about you
my world's an empty world without you
it's you or no one for me
for me"
632,bewitched,ella fitzgerald,Jazz,"after one whole quart of brandy like a daisy, i'm awake with no bromo-seltzer handy i don't even shake men are not a new sensation i've done pretty well i think but this half-pint imitation put me on the blink i'm wild again, beguiled again a simpering, whimpering child again bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am i couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep when love came and told me, i shouldn't sleep bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am i lost my heart, but what of it he is cold i agree he can laugh, but i love it although the laugh's on me i'll sing to him, each spring to him and long, for the day when i'll cling to him bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am i he's a fool and don't i know it but a fool can have his charms i'm in love and don't i show it like a babe in arms love's the same old sad sensation lately i've not slept a wink since this half-pint imitation put me on the blink i've sinned a lot, i'm mean a lot but i'm like sweet seventeen a lot bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am i i'll sing to him, each spring to him and worship the trousers that cling to him bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am i when he talks, he is seeking words to get, off his chest horizontally speaking, he's at his very best vexed again, perplexed again thank god, i can be oversexed again bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am i wise at last, my eyes at last, are cutting you down to your size at last bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more burned a lot, but learned a lot and now you are broke, so you earned a lot bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more couldn't eat, was dispeptic life was so hard to bear now my heart's antiseptic since you moved out of there romance, finis. your chance, finis. those ants that invaded my pants, finis. bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more"

634,guess i'll hang my tears out to dry,irene kral,Jazz,"when i want rain, i get sunny weather,
i'm just as blue as the sky;
since love is gone, can't pull myself together,
guess i'll hang my tears out to dry.

friends ask me out, i tell them i'm busy,
must get a new alibi!
i stay at home and ask myself, ""where is he?"",
guess i'll hang my tears out to dry.

dry little teardrops,
my little teardrops,
hangin' on a string of dreams.
fly little memories,
my little memories,
remind him of our crazy schemes.

somebody said, ""just forget about him!"",
i gave that treatment a try.
strangely enough, i got along without him,
then one day he passed me right by;
oh, well, i guess i'll hang my tears out to dry.
little teardrops,
little teardrops, filled with dreams."
635,rock it for me,ella fitzgerald,Jazz,"i heard it came to town
a new kind of rhythm

oh, rock it for me

every night
you'll see all the nifties
plenty tight
swingin' down the fifties
now they're all through with symphony
ho ho ho, rock it for me

now it's true that once upon a time
the opera was the thing
but today the rage is rhythm and rhyme
so won't you satisfy my soul
with the rock and roll?

you can't be tame
while the band is playin'
it ain't no shame
to keep your body swayin'
beat it out in the minor key
ho ho ho, rock it for me

can't you hear me singin', la-la-la-la-la
while the band is swingin'
oh, chick webb's sockin'
and the band is rockin'
so send me lightly, politely
brightly, and slightly
ho ho ho, rock it for me

now i'm all through with this stuff they call symphony
come on, boys, and sorta rock it for me

it's true that once upon a time
the opera was the thing
but today the rage is rhythm and rhyme

with the rock and roll?

you can't be tame
while the band is playin'
it ain't no shame

without a care 
open the door 
but no-one's there 

the lonely night 
my only friend 
love's wrongs are right 
i can't defend 

la passione 
la passione 
la passione 
la passione 

and now i know 
what i've become 
it haunts me so 
but i'll go on and on 

i know the pain inside 
is the price you pay to ride 
into the brightest flame 
never the same again

638,"i surrender, dear",thelonious monk,Jazz,"pride, sad, splendid liar,  
sworn enemy of love
kept my lips from saying
things i was thinking of.
but now my pride you've humbled,
i've cast it to the winds,
broken, beaten, sick at heart
my confession begins.
 
we've played the game of stay away
but it cost more that i can pay.
without you i can't make my way,
i surrender, dear.

i may seem proud, i may act gay,
it's just a pose, i'm not that way,
'cause deep down in my heart i say
i surrender, dear.

little mean things we were doing
must have been part of the game,
lending a spice to the wooing,
but i don't care who's to blame.
when stars appear and shadows fall,
why then you'll hear my poor heart call,
to you my love, my life, my all
i surrender, dear.

640,johnny one note,ella fitzgerald,Jazz,"johnny could only sing one note
and the note he sings was this
ah!
poor johnny one-note
sang out with ""gusto""
and just overlorded the place
poor johnny one-note
yelled willy nilly
until he was bleu in the face
for holding one note was his ace
couldn't hear the brass
couldn't hear the drum
he was in a class
by himself, by gum!

poor johnny one-note
got in aida
indeed a great chance to be brave
he took his one note
howled like the north wind
brought forth wind that made critics rave,
while verdi turned round in his grave!

couldn't hear the flute
or the big trombone
ev'ry one was mute
johnny stood alone.
cats and dogs stopped yapping
lions in the zoo
all were jealous of johnny's big trill
thunder claps stopped clapping,
traffic ceased its roar,
and they tell us niag'ra stood still.
he stopped the train whistles,
boat whistles,
steam whistles,
cop whistles,
all whistles bowed to his skill
sing johnny one-note,
sing out with ""gusto"" and
just overwhelm all the crowd
ah!
so sing johnny one-note, out loud!!
sing johnny one-note
sing johnny one-note out loud!"

you're so like the lady with the mystic smile
is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
for that mona lisa strangeness in your smile
do you smile to tempt a lover mona lisa?
or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
they just lie there, and they die there
are you warm, are you real mona lisa?
or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

over the shadows and the rain
to a blossom covered lane

and in your lonely flight
haven't you heard the music in the night?
wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

cause of the love in your eyes

you sit & twiddle

and you linger like a haunting refrain
and i find you spinning round in my brain
like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

you go to my head
like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
and i find the very mention of you
like the kicker in a julep or two

the thrill of the thought
that you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
still i say to myself get a hold of yourself
can't you see that it never can be?

you go to my head
with a smile that makes my temperature rise
like a summer with a thousand july's
you intoxicate my soul with your eyes

though i'm certain that this heart of mine
hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
you go to my head
you go to my head"

i have saved all my ribbons for thee.
if i, if i have been unkind,
i hope that you can just let it go by.
if i, if i have been untrue
i hope you know it was never to you.

like a baby, stillborn,
like a beast with his horn
i have torn everyone who reached out for me.
but i swear by this song
and by all that i have done wrong
i will make it all up to thee.
i saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,
he said to me, ""you must not ask for so much.""
and a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door,
she cried to me, ""hey, why not ask for more?""

oh like a bird on the wire,
like a drunk in a midnight choir
i have tried in my way to be free."

698,be a clown,judy garland,Jazz,"i'll remember forever
when i was but three
mama, who was clever
remarking to me
if son when you're grown up
you want everything nice
i've got your future sewn up
if you take this advice

be a clown, be a clown
all the world loves a clown
act the fool, play the calf
and you'll always have the last laugh

wear the cap and the bells
and you'll rate with all the great swells
if you become a doctor, folks'll face you with dread
if you become a dentist, they'll be glad when you're dead
you'll get a bigger hand if you can stand on your head
be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

be a clown, be a clown
all the world loves a clown
show 'em tricks, tell 'em jokes
and you'll only stop with top folks

be a crack jackanapes
and they'll imitate you like apes
why be a great composer with your rent in arrears
why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years
when crowds'll pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears
be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

be a clown, be a clown
all the world loves a clown
if you just make 'em roar
watch your mounte bank account soar

wear a painted mustache
and you're sure to make a big splash
a college education i should never propose
a bachelor's degree won't even keep you in clothes
but millions you will win if you can spin on your nose
be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

give 'em quips, give 'em fun
and they'll happy to say you're a-1
if you become a farmer you've the weather to buck
if you become a gambler you'll be stuck with your luck
but jack you'll never lack if you can quack like a duck
be a clown, be a clown, be a clown"
699,easy to love,al hirt,Jazz,"i know too well that i'm just wasting precious time
in thinking such a thing could be
that you could ever care for me
i'm sure you hate to hear
that i adore you, dear
but grant me

just the same
i'm not entirely to blame
for love
you'd be so easy to love
so easy to idolize
all others above
so worth the yearning for
so swell to keep every home fire burning for

we'd be so grand at the game
so carefree together
that it does seem a shame
that you can't see
your future with me
cause you'd be oh, so easy to love"
700,you don't know what love is,george shearing,Jazz,"you don't know what love is
'til you've learned the meaning of the blues
until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
you don't know what love  is.

you don't know how lips hurt
until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
you don't know what love is.

do you know how a lost heart fears
at the thought of reminiscing,
and how lips that taste of tears
lose their taste for kissing?
you don't know how hearts burn
for love that can, not live yet never dies.
until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
you don't know what love is."
701,the lady is a tramp,tony bennett,Jazz,"she gets too hungry, for dinner at eight
she loves the theater, but she never comes late
she never bother, with people she hate
that's why this chick is a tramp

she doesn't like crap games, with barons and earls
won't go to harlem, in ermines and pearls
won't dish out dirt, with the rest of the girls
that's why the lady is a tramp

she likes the free, fresh wind in her hair
life without care, she's broke, it's old
she hate california, it's crowded and damp
that's why the lady is a tramp

she likes the free, fresh wind in her hair
life without care, she's broke, it's old
she hate california, it's crowded and damp
that's why the lady is a tramp

703,fascinating rhythm,oscar peterson,Jazz,"got a little rhythm, a rhythm, a rhythm 
that pit-a-pats through my brain; 
so darn persistent, 
the day isn't distant 

when it'll drive me insane. 
comes in the morning 
without any warning, 
and hangs around me all day. 

i'll have to sneak up to it 
someday, and speak up to it. 
i hope it listens when i say: 

fascinating rhythm, 
you've got me on the go! 
fascinating rhythm, 
i'm all a-quiver. 

when a mess you're making! 
the neighbours want to know 
why i'm always shaking 
just like a flivver. 

each morning i get up with the sun 
start a-hopping, 
never stopping 
to find at night no work has been done. 

i know that 
once it didn't matter 
but now you're doing wrong; 
when you start to patter 

i'm so unhappy. 
won't you take a day off? 
decide to run along 
somewhere far away off  

and make it snappy! 
oh, how i long to be the man i used to be! 
fascinating rhythm, 
oh won't you stop picking on me?"
704,brazilian love affair,george duke,Jazz,"in the morning 
on the beach there 
people gather 
to meet the sunshine 

with open arms 
reaching for heaven 
with open hearts 
and open minds 

i found a lover 
by the seaside 
with sexy brown skin 
and haunting eyes 

time keeps passing 
but no one cares 
life for living 
is the thing there 
be yourself, be free 

2nd verse: 
in bahia 
and in rio 
in san paulo 
in brasilia 

sandy beaches 
cooling breezes 
sexy women 
calling to you 
for you aaaaahh... (continue aaahhs until break)
"
705,just friends [#],ralph sutton,Jazz,"just friends, lovers no more
just friends, but not like before
to think of what we've been and not to kiss again
seems like pretending it isn't the ending
two friends drifting apart
two friends, but one broken heart
we loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died"
706,what-s-new,chet-baker,Jazz,"what's new?
how is the world treating you?
you haven't changed a bit
handsome as ever i must admit
what's new?
how did that romance come through?
we haven't met since then
gee, but it's nice to see you again
what's new?
probably i'm boring you
but seeing you is grand
and you were sweet to offer your hand
i understand
adieu
pardon my asking what's new
of course you couldn't know
i haven't changed
i still love you so"
707,the shadow of your smile,irene kral,Jazz,"the shadow of your smile
when you have gone
will color all my dreams
and light the dawn

look into my eyes my love and see
all the lovely things you are to me

our wistful little star
it was far, too high
a teardrop kissed your lips
and so did i

now when i remember spring
all the joys that love can bring
i will be remembering
the shadow of your smile"
708,all i ever ask,najee,Jazz,"love means so many different things
but you're all that matters
and this is all i'll ever ask of you

tell me your dreams so they can be mine too
let me be there to help them come true
tell me your fears when you feel afraid
come to my arms, let me rock them away

that's all i'll ever ask
that's all i'll ever ask
that's all i'll ever ask
that's all i'll ever ask of you

come to my shoulder when you need to weep
wake me up when you can not sleep
talk to me when you want to be heard
be silent with me when you can't say a word

that's all i'll ever ask
that's all i'll ever ask
that's all i'll ever ask
that's all i'll ever ask of you

i can't swear
you'll never have to cry another tear
but whenever you want someone to hold you
i'm always right here

so just take my hand when you stumble and fall
call my name, it's yours to call
feel my faith in you when you can't find your own
and always remember you're never alone

that's all i'll ever ask
that's all i'll ever ask
that's all i'll ever ask 
that's all i'll ever ask of you"
709,interlude,june christy,Jazz,"a corner of the world
a moment out of time
two people chance to meet
how bitter sweet
how sublime
and clinging there a while 
to gaze across the years
and hope the sun that sets
brings no regrets
and no tears
and the farewell bow
the lingered kiss goodbye
and who explains the how
and why
these are memories for our time
two think an escapade
a fly by night affair
became an interlude
that i've perused
everywhere"
710,when my sugar walks down the street,red nichols,Jazz,"when my sugar walks down the street
all the little birdies go tweet, tweet, tweet.
and in the evening when the sun goes down
it's never dark when she's around

she's so affectionate and i'll say this
that when she kisses me i sure stay kissed
when my sugar walks down the street
the little birdies go tweet tweet tweet.
"
711,when a woman loves a man,tony bennett,Jazz,"maybe he's not much
just another man doing what he can
what does she care
when a woman loves a man

she'll just string along
all through thick and thin till his ship comes in
it's always that way
when a woman loves a man

she'll be the first one to praise him when he's going strong
the last one to blame him when everything is wrong
it's such a one sided game that they play
but women are funny that way

tell her she's a fool
she'll say, ""yes i know but i love him so""
and that's how it goes
when a woman loves a man

tell her she's a fool
she'll say, ""yes i know but i love him so""
and that's how it goes
when a woman loves a man"

714,when the midnight choo choo leaves for alabam',michael feinstein,Jazz,"i've had a mighty busy day
i've had to pack my things away
now i'm going to give the landlord back his key
the very key
that opened up my dreary flat
where many weary nights i sat
thinking of the folks down home who think of me
you can bet you'll find me singing happily

[chorus:]
when the midnight choo-choo leaves for alabam'
i'll be right there
i've got my fare
when i see that rusty-haired conductor-man
i'll grab him by the collar 
and i'll holler
""alabam'! alabam'!""
that's where you stop your train
that brings me back again
down home where i'll remain
where my honey-lamb am
i will be right there with bells
when that old conductor yells
""all aboard! all aboard!
all aboard for alabam'""

[2nd verse:]
the minute that i reach the place
i'm goin' to overfeed my face
'cause i haven't had a good meal since the day 
i went away
i'm goin' to kiss my pa and ma
a dozen times for ev'ry star
shining over alabama's new mown hay
i'll be glad enough to throw myself away "
715,here's to life,joe williams,Jazz,"no complaints and no regrets
i still believe in chasing dreams and placing bets
for i have learned that all you give is all you get
so give it all you've got
i had my share, i drank my fill
and even though i'm satisfied
i'm hungry still
to see what's down another road beyond the hill
and do it all again

so here's to life
and all the joy it brings
yes, here's to life
and dreamers and their dreams

funny, funny how the time just flies
how love can go from warm and those to sad goodbyes
and leave you with the memories you memorize
to keep your winters warm
how love can turn from warm hellos to sad goodbyes
and leave you with the memories you've memorized
to keep your winters warm

there's no yes in yesterday
and who knows what tomorrow brings or takes away?
as long as i'm still in the game, i want to play
for laughs, for life, for love
so here's to life and all the joy it brings
yes, here's to life
and dreamers and their dreams
may all your storms be weathered
and all that's good gets better

here's to life, here's to love, here's to you
may all your storms be weathered
and all that's good gets better
here's to life, here's to love, here's to you

716,prisioner of love,ben bernie,Jazz,"someone that i belong to
doesn't belong to me
someone who can't be faithful
knows that i have to be
wonder if i am wrong to give her my loyalty

why should i be a lone soul
why can't i be my own soul
alone from night to night you'll find me
too weak to break the chains that bind me
i need no shackles to remind me
i'm just a prisner of love
for one comand i stand and wait now

from one who's master of my fate now
i can't escape for it's too late now
i'm just a prisoner of love
what's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
those arms with me
although she has another
i can't have another
for i'm not free
she's in my dreams awake or sleeping
up on my knees to her i'm creeping
my very life is in her keeping
i'm just a prisoner of love.

717,for all we know,ann hampton callaway,Jazz,"for all we know we may never meet again
before you go make this moment sweet again
we won't say ""good night"" until the last minute

for all we know this may only be a dream
we come and go like a ripple on a stream
so love me tonight; tomorrow was made for some
tomorrow may never come for all we know

so love me tonight; tomorrow was made for some
tomorrow may never come for all we know"

of you and me

all those tender nights
and those endless days
they're all here inside

won't you chase my clouds away?
i'd give anything to see the sun again
only you can stop these tears from falling
i can't face another day
baby, can you stop
can you stop the rain?

ev'rywhere i go, i feel you there
following my footsteps like a shadow
of my broken heart
sometimes, it's a pair of passing eyes
or it's just the way someone is talking
and there you are

am i all alone?
don't you ever wake up
and reach for me
where i used to be?
is there any chance?
i just can't believe
you're not lonely, too
just for me and you

if you were here for only one night
baby, i know you'd remember
'cause loving you once wasn't time enough
i know we can make it together
together

baby, stop the rain
won't you chase my clouds away?
i'd give anything to see the sun again
only you can stop these tears of mine from falling

can you, can you stop the rain?

i thought i'd get another message off to you

hmmm! i settled down in paris
hmmm! i get to love them weekends too
i'd like to pitch a tent by your back fence
and yell and scream all night this message overdue:

""i'd just like to hold you, enfold you and make it right

let me sing this song again just like it's new

hmmm! but perhaps that's really not quite true
woa! 'cause if your friend was right and you really called last night

they got a gal there, a pretty gal there,
who's colder than an arctic storm,
got a heart just like a stone,
even ice men leave her alone!

they call her hard hearted hannah,
the vamp of savannah,
the meanest gal in town,
leather is tough, but hannah's heart is tougher,
she's a gal who loves to see men suffer!
to tease 'em, and thrill 'em, to torture and kill 'em,
is her delight, they say,
i saw her at the seashore with a great big pan,
there was hannah pouring water on a drownding man!
she's hard hearted hannah, the vamp of savannah, ga!

they call her hard hearted hannah,
the vamp of savannah,
the meanest gal in town,
talk of your cold, refrigeratin' mamas,
brother, she's a polar bear's pajamas!
to tease 'em, and thrill 'em, to torture and kill 'em,
is her delight, they say,
an evening spent with hannah sittin' on your knees,
is like travelin' through alaska in your b-v-d's.
she's hard hearted hannah, the vamp of savannah, ga!

can you imagine a woman as cold as hannah
she's got the right name, the vamp of savannah
any time a woman can take a great big pan
and start pouring water on a drownin' man
she's hard hearted hannah
the vamp of savannah ga

oh she's sweet as sour milk"
729,why was i born,aretha franklin,Jazz,"spending these lonesome evenings
with nothing to do
but to live in dreams that i make up
all by myself

dreaming that you're beside me
i picture the prettiest stories
only to wake up
all by myself

what is the good of me by myself?

why was i born
why am i living
what do i get
what am i giving

why do i want a thing
i daren't hope for
what can i hope for
i wish i knew

why do i try
to draw you near me
why do i do i cry
you never hear me

i'm a poor fool
but what can i do
why was i born
to love you

i'm a poor fool

to love you"

i can afford to board a chattanooga choo choo
i've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
 
you leave the pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
read a magazine and then you're in baltimore
dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
than to have your ham 'n' eggs in carolina
 
when you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
then you know that tennessee is not very far
shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'
woo, woo, chattanooga, there you are
 
there's gonna be a certain party at the station
satin and lace, i used to call funny face
she's gonna cry until i tell her that i'll never roam"

and how did i guess that the long loneliness was past
i merely looked at you and i knew then and there i knew
it's you or no one for me

i'm sure of this every time we kiss
now and forever when forever is done
you'll find that you are still the one

so please don't say no to my plea
cause if you do then i'm all through
there's this about you
my world's an empty world without you
it's you or no one for me

it's a matter of now and forever
when forever is all done
you'll find you are still the one

so please don't say no to my plea

railroad bill and the kitten
railroad bill and the kitten

text:
railroad bill was a hard livin' man
he used to take his women two at a time
everyone agreed he was the baddest engineer
that'd ever driven down the santa fe line
his name was known from the folks back home
to the tippy-top of telegraph hill
and all the little boys, when they were sneakin' cigarettes
they used to dream about the railroad bill
[spoken: stay with me here
one day bill was walkin' along
and he saw a kitten stuck in a tree
when he saw what was the matter he ran to get a ladder
to set that kitty-cat free
and bill said, ""no, ain't gonna do it
ain't gonna climb up no tree
this is a stupid, stupid song and no folksinger's
gonna make a fool outa me.""
i said, one day bill was walkin' along
and he saw a kitten stuck in a tree
when he saw what was the matter he ran to get a ladder
to set that kitty-cat free
and bill said, ""no, ain't gonna do it
ain't gonna do what you said
this is an asinine song. as far as i'm concerned
that cat can stay there till it's dead.""
i said, wait a minute, bill, you can't argue with me
for god's sake, i just made you up
i got the pen in my hand, i want you up in that tree
i want that cat unstuck
bill said, ""no, i hate cats
ain't gonna climb for no cat.""
he said, ""why don't you have me save some beautiful girl
whos's been tied down on the railroad track?""
i said maybe there'll be room in the eighth or ninth verse
but right now i want you up in that tree
i'm the writer, god damn, i got the pen in my hand
and you're supposed to listen to me
he said, ""you asshole. why should i listen to you
you should be listenin' to me instead.""
he said, ""i'm a railroad man and if i was real
i would separate your face from your head.""
you ungrateful brute, i cried, you push me too far
i gotta show you i can do as i please
so an earthquake came and it shook the whole terrain
and it brought railroad bill to his knees
and then a tidal wave broke and everything got soaked
and bill was almost completely washed away
and then a big green monster from the planet neptune
landed and bit railroad bill on the leg
i got the pen in my hand. i can do what i want
i'm a bright new young talent on the rise
so get your ass up that tree or i swear you ain't
gonna get outa my folksong alive
he said, ""you don't scare me.
you might be crazy but you don't scare me
and if you don't leave me alone i'm gonna tell everybody
where you stole this melody.""
but before he could speak his tongue fell out
and he could not make a sound
suddenly he jumped on top of me and he grabbed me by the neck
and he pulled me to the ground
and he hit me in the stomach, and he hit me in the face real hard
and i think he almost broke my nose
but just then a lightning bolt came outa nowhere, hit him right between the
[eyes
and killed him instantly
[heh, heh
well the cat came down from the tree
had a bowl of warm milk, went to sleep for the night
railroad bill is survived by a wife and three small children

733,something to live for,tommy flanagan,Jazz,"i have almost ev'ry thing a human could desire,
cars and houses, bear-skin rugs to lie before my fire
but there's something missing,
something isn't there,
it seems i'm never kissing the one whom i care for.
i want something to live for
someone to make my life an adventurous dream
oh, what wouldn't i give for 
someone who'd take my life 
and make it seem gay as they say it ought to be.
why can't i have love like that brought to me?
my eye is watching the noon crowds 
searching the promenades seeking a clue
to the one who will someday be my 
something to live for.

734,polka dots and moonbeams,bill evans,Jazz,"a country dance was being held in a garden
i felt a bump and heard an ""oh, beg your pardon""
suddenly i saw polka dots and moonbeams
all around a pug-nosed dream

the music started and was i the perplexed one
i held my breath and said ""may i have the next one?""
in my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

there were questions in the eyes of other dancers
as we floated over the floor
there were questions but my heart knew all the answers
and perhaps a few things more

now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
i know the meaning of the words ""ever after""
and i'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
when i kiss the pug-nosed dream"
735,how am i to know?,shirley horn,Jazz,"oh, how am i to know if it's really love that found its way here,
oh, how am i to know, will it linger on, and leave me there.
i dare not guess at this strange happiness
oh, how am i to know, can it be that love has come to stay here,"
736,smile,dianne reeves,Jazz,"you could smile away the storm clouds
even fill an empty space
and it feels just like sunshine baby
when that smile lights up your face
i'm so glad we're together

i can't dream of a better place
that i'd rather be
than right here with you loving me
with a smile that makes the angels start to sing

la la la la la la...
la la la la la la...

and i know there's no better place
that i'd rather be
when you hold me close in your arms
i can feel your heart beat inside of me

i have found my oasis
a treasure island in the sea
waves of love and understanding
with a smile that captivated me
i will cherish the day
that you chased all my storm clouds away
with your smile"

738,culture of fear,thievery corporation,Jazz,"seems to me like they want us to be afraid, man
or maybe we just like being afraid
maybe we just so used to it at this point 
that it's just a part of us, part of our culture

it's been on orange since '01, g 
i mean wassup man, can't a brother get yellow, man
just for like two months or something
goddamn, sick of that

mic check
the groom is dead so i'mma rhyme like a lunatic
i do this shit with the non-assuming wit
the corporation caught you up bassing the tempo
my name is lift baster intro now let's go
the flow of life throwing strife into the mix
to the big dark condition and the word is sick
the powers to be, a power in me
to speak of our stress and strife that i see everyday
and more to speak of our culture of fear, it's up in your ear
they're telling us terrorists are about to strike
maybe tonight, right

let me just back up slowly with critical analysis 
of those who control me
it used to be just had a screen in the crib on the tv
but now we carry screens when we leave
see laptops, smart phones, now we're never alone
a little affliction i call a media dome
but on the low famine is the programmin'
you want to watch your favorite show because it's so slammin'
hold hands and let's gaze into the beautiful glare 
while we're here so immersed in this culture of fear, fear, fear

yo we fear the irs, fear the ins, fear god
i'm more afraid of a credit card than a terror squad
but really y'all, we're suspecting the weapons overseas, 
yet master card and visa won't allow me to breathe
they deceive the enemy is in the fine print
they assassinate salad with no single assailant
walls i am stealing to get the view of the blue skies
beautiful ? trying to survive ?
representin' element ahead, a sentiment that you feel 
when you know for real

the deal starts with a sparkle moved with a handshake 
physical to alter your subliminal landscape
you leave thinking i can really trust that guy
to be honest with you, you should've really punched that guy
now it's operation shake-a-banker, thank-you for the loan
see you when you come to repossess my home
alone at night, sweating of visions of armageddon
i've never seen the threat, yet i feel threatened
parts of our society designed to smear freedom 
don't succumb to this culture fear
don't succumb to this culture fear
don't succumb to this culture fear"
739,but not for me,bill evans,Jazz,"old man sunshine listen you
never tell me dreams come true
just try it and i'll start a riot
beatrice fairfax don't you dare
ever tell me he will care
i'm certain it's the final curtain
i never want to hear from any cheerful pollyannas
who tell you fate supplies a mate
it's all bananas

they're writing songs of love but not for me
a lucky star's above but not for me
with love to lead the way i've found more clouds of gray
than any russian play could guarantee

i was a fool to fall and get that way
hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
although i can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
i guess he's not for me

footsteps that you hear down the hall
the laugh that floats on a summer night
that you can never quite recall

and you see laura on the train that is passing through
those eyes how familiar they seem
she gave your very first kiss to you
that was laura but she's only a dream

card sharks and crap-shooters.
they congregate around the metropole.
they wear fancy ties and laces,

they all have got an ace down in the hole!

some of them write to the old folks for coin,

that's their old ace in the hole.

'neath a willow tree.

right here our romance was started,
here again we parted
when i set you free.
all my thoughts are jumbled,
everything is blurred,
all the world has crumbled,
shattered by word.

my end has come,
my heart is numb,
'twas like a bolt from the blue above.
i can't believe it but you're gone, darling,
and here lies love.

the sky is dark
and i hear a lark,
he sounds as sad as a mournful dove.
the dew appears like the tears of dawn, darling,
for here lies love.

all my dreams lost beyond recall,
dreams of spring blasted in the fall,
you gave lips, you gave arms,
i gave all!

i ought to cry,
my eyes are dry,
there's only one thing i'm conscious of;
i only know that i can't go on, darling,
here lies love.

my end has come,

and the foxhunter blows his horn

i ran away to charlottesville 
and worked in a sawmill or two

what have they done to the old home place 
why did they tear it down
and why did i leave the plow in the field
and look for a job in the town

well my girl she ran off with somebody else
the taverns took all my pay
and here i stand where the old home stood

754,they all laughed,sarah vaughan,Jazz,"the odds were a hundred-to-one against me
the world thought the heights were too high to climb
but people from missouri never incensed me

for from history i had learned
how many, many times the worm had turned

they all laughed at christopher columbus
when he said the world was round
they all laughed when edison recorded sound
they all laughed at wilbur and his brother
when they said that man could fly

they told marconi
wireless was a phony
it's the same old cry
they laughed at me wanting you
said i was reaching for the moon
but, oh, you came through
now they'll have to change their tune

they all said we never could be happy
they laughed at us and how
but ho, ho, ho
who's got the last laugh now?

they all laughed at rockefeller center
now they're fighting to get in
they all laughed at whitney and his cotton gin
they all laughed at fulton and his steamboat
hershey and his chocolate bar

ford and his lizzie
kept the laughers busy
that's how people are
they laughed at me wanting you
said it would be, ""hello, goodbye""
but, oh, you came through
now they're eating humble pie

they all said we'd never get together

for ho, ho, ho
who's got the last laugh?

let's at the past laugh
ha, ha, ha
who's got the last laugh now?"
755,greatest love of all,shirley bassey,Jazz,"i believe that children are our future;
teach them well and let them lead the way.
show them all the beauty they possess inside.
give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
everybody's searching for a hero;
people need someone to look up to.
i never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
a lonely place to be, and so i learned to depend on me.
 
i decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
if i fail, if i succeed. 
at least i lived as i believe. 
no matter what they take from me,
they can't take away my dignity.
 
because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
i found the greatest love of all inside of me.
the greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

""you can't take those guitars on board""

heard it all before

and as they're starting to serve champagne
to the folks at the front of the plane
i can hear the engines roaring
we're on our way

and we are flying home

flying home at last
flying home
i've got the freedom in my soul

my world is calling
speeding through the universe tonight

as she waits, ""where are those guys?""
yes, it's nice to see old butch and sundance in the sky

it's like looking down on paradise
there's a ball of fire that's burning
giving life

761,how long has this been going on?,barney kessel,Jazz,"as a tot, when i trotted in little velvet panties,
i was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than dante's.

so my dear i swore,
""never, never more !""
on my list, i insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
now, i find i was blind, and oh my! how i lost out!

i could cry salty tears,
where have i been all these years?
little wow, tell me now:
how long has this been going on?

there were chills up my spine,
and some thrills i can't define.
listen, sweet, i repeat:
how long has this been going on?

oh, i feel that i could melt,
into heaven i'm hurled!
i know how columbus felt,
finding another world.

kiss me once, then once more.
what a dunce i was before.
what a break! for heaven's sake!
how long has this been going on?

dear, when in your arms i creep,
that divine rendezvous,
don't wake me, if i'm asleep,
let me dream that it's true!

kiss me twice, then once more.
that makes thrice, let's make it four!
what a break! for heaven's sake!
how long has this been going on?

after the night and the music die
will i have you?

the perfect lover someday,
i knew i'd recognize him if ever
he came 'round my way.
i always used to fancy then
he'd be one of the god-like kind of men
with a giant brain and a noble head
like the heroes bold
in the books i've read.

but along came bill
who's quite the opposite of all
the men in storybooks
in grace and looks
i know that apollo
would beat him
all hollow

and i can't explain,
it's surely not his brain
that makes me thrill
i love him because he's wonderful,
because he's just my bill.

he can't play golf or tennis or polo,
or sing a solo, or row.
he isn't half as handsome
as dozens of men that i know.
he isn't tall or straight or slim
and he dresses far worse than ted or jim.
and i can't explain why he should be
just the one, one man in the world for me.

he's just my bill, an ordinary man,
he hasn't got a thing that i can brag about.
and yet to be
upon his knee
so comfy and roomy
seems natural to me.
oh, i can't explain,
it's surely not his brain
that makes me thrill
i love him because he's, i don't know
because he's just my bill."

and love becomes laughter and lullabies
and while we are dreaming, time flies

and while we are dreaming we meet and exchange
conversations routinely and nothing seems strange
but when we are awake there's a sense of unease
that another night's gone just as quick as you please

and night turns to dawn and then bright skies
and bright skies to picnics on warm julys
to deep umber autumns and winter goodbyes

779,love locked out,dexter gordon,Jazz,"love locked out in all the cold and rain,
love locked out may never come again.
love locked out and weeping bitter tears,
no-one ever hears him calling.

no-one needs the precious gift he brings,
no-one heeds the song of love he sings,
on the door he beats his tiny wings,
just love locked out.

a world without love is a world without life,
a sad world full of gloom,
so see there's a place for love in your heart,
why, he doesn't need much room.

love is well worth the waiting for,
when he comes knocking at your door,
fling it wide open, for love locked out
will come no more, no more.

couldn't get it for free, couldn't do it for the money.
it just disappeared, spent a lot of bearin' years.

nobody ever said you'd be dead forever.

goosebumps been gone, for way to long.
who knows how long, they'll stick around.

you and your glance make this romance too hot to handle
stars in the night blazing their light can't hold a candle
to your razzle-dazzle
you've got me flyin' high and wide on a magic carpet ride

full of butterflies inside
want to cry, want to croon, want to laugh like a loon

and romance drops in from the blue
cherchez l'amour i beg of you please endure
my taking a brief detour with somebody new
it's just that when in rome i do as the romans do

and though from italy i lied to you prettily
why think of me bitterly
you know that i'm true

except now and then in rome
i get that old yearn in rome
and naturally when in rome
i do as the romans do

if i write happily
best wishes from napoli
don't cable me snappily
to tell me we're through

i do as the romans

but here we are, a bridge too far
i've left you here to wonder if it all was a game
how can it be, these changes in me

nothing lasts forever, that's true
take a look at the world that we once knew
gone are the feelings that once we could hold on to

[chorus]
try to forgive me, find a way to believe me
i'm hurting the same way too
oh i know it's not easy, but baby believe me
we've been fighting this war far too long
where did we go wrong

i tried to write a letter, but it's better this way
here in this place, face to face
let's not forsake the future in view of the past
so little gained and far too much pain

trying to compromise our points of view
we leave each other feeling blue
gone are the feelings that once would have seen us through

784,how deep is the ocean?,bill evans,Jazz,"how much do i love you?
i'll tell you no lie
how deep is the ocean?
how high is the sky?

how many times a day do i think of you?
how many roses are sprinkled with dew?

how far would i travel
to be where you are?
how far is the journey
from here to a star?

and if i ever lost you, how much would i cry?
how deep is the ocean?
how high is the sky?

how far would i travel

how far is the journey

785,the party's over,russ freeman,Jazz,"the party's over, it's time to call it a day
they've burst your pretty balloon
and taken the moon away
it's time to wind up the masquerade
just make your mind up
the piper must be paid

the party's over, the candles flicker and dim
you danced and dreamed through the night
it seemed to be right just being with him
now you must wake up, all dreams must end
take off your makeup, the party's over
it's all over, my friend

the party's over, it's time to call it a day
they've burst your pretty balloon
and taken the moon away
now you must wake up, all dreams must end
take off your makeup, the party's over
it's all over, my friend

786,deep night,ruth etting,Jazz,"deep night, stars in the sky above, 
moonlight, lighting our place of love, 
night winds, seem to have gone to rest, 
two eyes brightly with love are gleaming. 

come to my arms, my dear one, my sweetheart, my own, 
vow that you'll love me always, and be mine alone. 

deep night, whispering trees above, 
kind night, bringing you nearer, dearer and dearer, 
deep night, deep in the arms of love."
787,i didn't know what time it was,stan getz,Jazz,"once i was young
yesterday, perhaps
danced with jim and paul
and kissed some other chaps

once i was young
but never was naive
i thought i had a trick or two
up my imaginary sleeve
and now i know i was naive

i didn't know what time it was
then i met you
oh, what a lovely time it was
how sublime it was too

i didn't know what day it was
you held my hand
warm like the month of may it was
and i'll say it was grand

grand to be alive, to be young
to be mad, to be yours alone
grand to see your face, feel your touch
hear your voice say, ""i'm all your own""

i didn't know what year it was
life was no prize
i wanted love and here it was
shining out of your eyes
i'm wise and i know what time it is now

grand to be alive, to be young
to be mad, to be yours alone
grand to see your face, feel your touch
hear your voice say, ""i'm all your own""

i didn't know what year it was
life was no prize
i wanted love and here it was
shining out of your eyes
i'm wise and i know what time it is now"
788,the night has a thousand eyes,gloria lynne,Jazz,"don't whisper things to me you don't mean
for words deep down inside can be seen by the night
the night has a thousand eyes
and it knows the truth apart from one that lies

the romance may have cooled in the past
my love for you will be everlasting and bright
as bright as a starlit sky
and the wondrous night that has a thousand eyes

i've lived my life walking through a dream
for i knew that i would find this moment supreme
a night of bliss and tender sighs
and the smiling down of a thousand eyes

a night of bliss and tender sighs
and the smiling down of a thousand eyes
the night has a thousand eyes"

day starts with a blast of feedback,
still spinning from the night that we had,
in the mirror where i brush my teeth at,
there's three more heads, and they watching me back,
read the bread while i toast my pay check,
one the girls said grins a safe bet,
phone ringing an i refuse to take it,
want to play dead but i'm on the dayshift,
stepping out on to the weekly rota,
on the cheap share a seat with olga,
train driver said it ain't a joka,
were gonna be stuck till i fix the motta,
half hour in-between the stations,
start jogging when i hit the pavement,
ran straight into a situation,
cops say stop cause i ain't caucasian,
whole hour on explanation,
missed the bus an the cab was ancient,
i'm really now in a situation,
when i return to my destination,
i get told to collect my payment,
clear the desk quick make it vacant,

do it now while i still remember,
small fish in a mixin' blenda,
all the bets set on the next offenda,
i had enough being nice and anxious,
i keep sweet all the trendy bankers,
i'm looking more than the war the pension,
under attack of the apprehension,
i'm too transformed to lose the motion,
i might shout now out and open,
all the hanging on the years of hopin',
the same things now feel provoking,
so hot that the tears are smoking,

watch now my might just crunch the whole thing,

yo, a slow burn we are
last long three man act to wake up your thermostat
blood through the property line
creative minds crossover and back
scribble with my knife to earn that slice of life
cock back, aim, shot the name wherever the price is right
the pain earned is the pain learned and it's talking like burn
connect (to the same as it ever was)
respect the lane cause it never flood, it's well irrigated
looking for my vanity, it's there, the mirror hate it
state it, stop being an mc and give your verses more weight
for being just empty, thoughts are oxidised when i spit em out
and my lungs prefer tastes encrypted words laced to get them out home
we're removal service to get kings out the throne
(more hands on) with hands upon the neck
of a voice magnifier over decks
the sound is found at the young's in the batch
lovely how i let my mind flow
you can catch me in the early morning
find me out with no yawning
have it been asleep i'm on q
8 in the corner pocket from the booth all 24 hours like it was our debut
life edited my etiquette
dreams beyond your eons
you can't wait this out
start blitz, starring it's that crew who never call 
the splits convey lines made from outer spine
so the nerve of us to be so damned crushed
grit like jdl and we sip from the grail
with a current course connect, so we not unsung
just vets, this mission's undone

rappers is not try and see me like a diamond tester
i'm all alone, i'm like a silent investor
well dressed, my suit and vest is never polyester
keep a shottie on the dresser
my queen look like a young pepper
up in her plump compress her
my tongue is forever under the weather, however
my heart was still lighter than a feather
culturally, snort em like cocoa leaf
them niggas suck more milk no tea
i'm on the low though in my polo tee
the show cost money but the promo's free
my pen collection is interesting
no steal, still niggas will feel threatened
my genetics is comedic
driven in lanes i was looking angelic
psychedelic, if you was like it i can sell it
but i don't fuck with that sweet shit, i'm diabetic
this is rapping at it's peak
the bird steady yapping at the beat

like right there, feeling the night air
promoting the fair fight
square dance, men at the face off
crooked eye letters from madoff, apologise
long journeys walking cold hard facts
once you turn up there, there's no turning back
my cocaine flow's the flows that i crack
the hemline, versus all my land

they hard working through on the scale
i'm joe pressure on the disk, so messy on the disk

go campaign raise the age
stay fresh like a pound of sage
that could rake the pound amount of figures

you came at last
love had its day
that day is past
you've gone away
this aching heart of mine is singing

all the darkness became light

babies and a patient wife

so he gave them up just to fill his cup
every sip would make him feel alive
no bones in his body were dry

he's got wrinkles and a crooked friend
he holds back tears thinking of the years
that the bottle had a long time down
so he'd sit have another round
singing hallelujah 'til it drowns

that they came to buy, and you chose to stay
soon a child will help you reap and sow
may he cast a long shadow

but you say the trials are coming, you have felt the gathering forces
and the galloping you hear is of one too many horses
but rest your head my darling girl, there won't be any danger
any christian ever loved an infant in a manger
saves the baby. they'll save the baby

says, ""the earth will bear like the promised land""

you might think it's a joke, but it ain't funny
to hurt someone who's so in love with you

a clown puts his make-up on upside down
so he wears a smile even when he wears a frown
you might think i'm here when you put me down
but actually i'm on the other side of town

my body's in this room with you just catching hell
while my soul is drinking beer down the road a spell
you might think i'm listening to your grocery list
but i'm leaning on the jukebox and i'm about half way there

a clown puts his make-up on upside down
so he wears a smile even when he wears a frown
you might think i'm here when you put me down
but actually i'm on the other side of town

i'm sittin' on a chair just behind my ear
playing dominoes and drinking some ice cold beer
when you get done talking i'll come back downstairs
and assume the body of the person you presume who cares

a clown puts his make-up on upside down
so he wears a smile even when he wears a frown
you might think i'm here when you put me down
but actually i'm on the other side of town
i'm across the river on the other side of town
in my mind i'm going to the dog racing side of town

well the time that was coming
the road has begun to move beneath my feet
good things come to an end
well i hope through the pain
the heartache and strain we can still remain friends

make me feel right
in a mississippi morning
she's an angel in flight
in a blink of an eye
she'll be out of your sight
something about a southern girl
you're a soft melody
well i swear that i heard
from a lost mockingbird stuck up in a tree
we got a lot going on
even though i'm not here
please don't shed any tears for me day when i'm gone
something about a southern girl
make me feel right
in a mississippi morning
she's an angel in flight
in a blink of an eye
she'll be out of your sight
something about a southern girl
i never meant to leave you lonely
it was only in your mind
girl, i never meant to leave you lonely
it was only a matter of time
something about a southern girl
make me feel right
in a mississippi morning
she's an angel in flight

the fields are dancing daisy bright
hills are dappled green
winter wind has ceased her labor
giving birth to blossom rain as sweet as rain
and maybe you will fall in love
and maybe you'll be mine
daisy summer pipers come to town
piping people out of doors
to see the magic all around
listen now you'll hear his sound
stare into a mirror pool
and laugh so princely vain
the skies become kaleidoscopes
with no two turns the same
and pebbles send them dancing off
in ripple rings of sun burnt cloud and windy blues
and maybe we will fall in love
before the day is through

listen now you'll hear his sound."
811,dark as a dungeon,pete seeger,Folk,"oh come all you young fellers so young and so fine
seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
it'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal
where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew danger is double pleasures are few
where the rain never falls the sun never shines
it's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

well it's many a man that i've seen in my day
(uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded)
like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
a man will have lust for the lure of the mine
and pray when i'm dead and my ages shall roll
that my body would blacken and turn into coal
then i'll look from the door of my heavenly home and pity the miner digging my bones
where it's dark as a dungeon"

and my father won't slight you for your lack of kind""
and she laid her hand on me and this she did say
""oh, it will not be long, love, till our wedding-day""

and she went away from me and moved through the fair
and fondly i watched her move here and move there
and then she went onward, just one star awake
like the swan in the evening moves over the lake

last night she came to me, my dead love came in
so softly she came that her feet made no din
and she laid her hand on me and this she did say
""oh, it will not be long, love, till our wedding-day"""

for never wanting you for long
seasons change, oh, so do i
though empty promises fool my songs

a cold wind's bending the morning
and the back road bears the pain
i came with the gift of a new day
see, i leave with a gift of rain

and see two leaves falling
see they kiss, then drift away
and it's true, i really wanted you
and it's true, i really wanted you
just yesterday...

i can see your eyes made for their crying
like a star was made to shine
my face was meant to bear knowledge
empty promises, fool lies

and see two leaves falling
see they kiss, then drift away
and it's true, i really wanted you
and it's true, i really wanted you
just yesterday...

so let us strike out
touch the new day
let our bruises meet there
like them, the rain has forsaken
we will need the greatest care

and see two leaves falling
see they kiss, then drift away
and it's true, i really wanted you
and it's true, i really wanted you
just yesterday...

strike me down if you wish
for not wanting you for long
seasons turn, so do i
though empty promises fool my songs"

but you come around in your time speaking of fabulous places create
an oasis that dries up as soon as you're gone
you leave me here burning in this desert without you

816,backlash love affair,richard thompson,Folk,"an iron maiden stole my heart away, o black day
her siren songs seemed to call to me, o destiny
she spat her thrash metal lyrics right into my mind
the stage thundered and the smoke bombs made me blind
she sang ""hello liebchen, wollen-sie ein jig-a-jig-a, nein?""
she said ""left, right, right, left
come on joe don't be slow.
up, down, down, up
come on joe, time to go.
in, out, out, in
do it if you love me joe""
i know it's art for art's sake but how much more can i take?
what's my share of this backlash love affair?
her hair extension's down to her knees, what a tease
she got tattoos everywhere you look, she's a comic book
why she goes for my type i'll never understand
she's so demure when we promenade hand in hand
and when we get back home she let's me know that she's in command
she said ""left, right, right, left
come on joe don't be slow.
up, down, down, up
come on joe, it's time to go.
in, out, out, in
do it if you love me joe""
i know it's art for art's sake but how much more can i take?
what's my share of this backlash love affair?

they wrap around you and the cold knives cut and stab
i can't live my life as someone else's shishkebab

you give them names and i won't deport you 
make sure you face my tape recorder 

make no mistake, this fountain pen 
could put you on a plane by ten

so now that you know whose skin you're saving

i think you know, so speak up, amigo

you should try to get up to lake michigan 
well maybe, but then again

where were we then? is he your friend? 
well i recommend that you look again 
where does he stay? what is his name? 
there is no shame. he'd do the same 
so what do you say? i don't have all day 
it's up to you. which will it be 
good citizen or poor campesino? 

my dad used to rent us this place in ontario 
he showed us how to cast the line and tie the flies 
he used to say that god rewards us for letting the small ones go 
well maybe, but i don't know 
anyway, it's easy to bite. 
you just take the bait 
you can't fight the hook 
hurts less if you don't try to dive 

senor, as you know i was a fisherman 
and how full the nets came in 
we hauled them up by hand 
but when we fled, i left them just out past the coral reefs 
they're waiting there for me

higher and higher

no one stirs in the town.

the morning after the rain
the barges move on the seine.

down the avenue lined with trees
paris bells ring on the breeze
paris bells ring on the breeze.

dawn is breaking, birds start to sing,
sun is rising, warms everything.

the echo of footsteps on a cobbled street,
dim alleyways where the shadows meet.

down the avenue lined with trees
paris bells ring on the breeze
paris bells ring on the breeze.

the places where we used to visit,
the chapel where we went to wed.

paris bells on the breeze
often stir memories.

we both knew the morning rain
we both wandered down the seine.

now you're gone away from me
you're just a memory
like the bells ring on the breeze,
paris bells ring on the breeze."

822,all thoughts are prey to some beast,bill callahan,Folk,"the leafless tree looked like a brain
the birds within were all the thoughts and desires within me
hoppin' around from branch to branch
or snug in their nests listenin' in
an eagle came over the horizon
and shook the branches with its sight
the softer thoughts: starlings
finches
and wrens
the softer thoughts
they all took flight
the eagle looked clear through the brain tree
empty he thought
save for me
maybe i'll make this one my home
consolidate the nests of the tiny
raise a family of might like me
then something struck him
wings of bone
sweet desires and soft thoughts were all gone
the eagle shrieked
""i'm alone""
well it was time to flee the tree
the eagle snuck up on the wind
one talon at a time
being sky king of the sky
what did he have to fear
all thoughts are prey to some beast
all thoughts are prey to some beast
all thoughts are prey to some beast
all thoughts are prey to some beast
all thoughts are prey to some beast

you can wake in this vale of tears
you can laugh like a child again
you can make it right you can make it wrong 
you can live the life you dream

what you see and you believe is not the answer
to anything that matters very much
anything you touch...is gone

in the valleys you look for the mountains
in the mountains you search the rivers
you have no where to go you are where you belong
you can live the life you dream
if you call him your master will find you
seven bars on the gate will not hold him
seven fires burning bright only give him delight
you can live the life you dream

all your treasure buys you nothing but the moment
all your poverty has lost you everything
love will teach your dream...to sing"
831,talk to me,joni mitchell,Folk,"there was a moon and a street lamp
i didn't know i drank such a lot
'till i pissed a tequila-anaconda
the full length of the parking lot!
oh, i talk too loose
again i talk too open and free
i pay a high price for my open talking
like you do for your silent mystery

come and talk to me
please talk to me
talk to me, talk to me
mr. mystery

we could talk about martha
we could talk about landscapes
i'm not above gossip
but i'll sit on a secret where honor is at stake!
or we could talk about power
about jesus and hitler and howard hughes
or charlie chaplin's movies
or bergman's nordic blues
please just talk to me
any old theme you choose
just come and talk to me
mr. mystery, talk to me

you could talk like a fool-i'd listen
you could talk like a sage
anyway the best of my mind
all goes down on the strings and the page
that mind picks up all these pictures
it still gets my feet up to dance
even though it's covered with keyloids
from the ""slings and arrows of outrageous romance""
i stole that from willy the shake!
you know, ""neither a borrower nor a lender be""
romeo, romeo talk to me!

is your silence that golden?
are you comfortable in it?
is it the key to your freedom
or is it the bars on your prison?
are you gagged by your ribbons?
are you really exclusive or just miserly?
you spend every sentence as if it was marked currency!
come and spend some on me,
shut me up and talk to me!
i'm always talking!
chicken squawking!
please talk to me"

833,seasoned-love,eleanor-mcevoy,Folk,"i felt anticipation early in the spring
i looked forward to the riches it would bring
i smiled the day it led my heart to you
it seemed like the world was smiling too
we laughed and drank and sang in summertime
i felt your body always close to mine
our love was so exciting and so new
it seemed like the world was lauging too
things got colder when the autumn came along
but we straightened out the things that had gone wrong
as the leaves displayed their ever changing hue
it seemed like the world was changing too
the winter brought the rain and then the snow
and i cried out loud the day i saw you go
i didn't really know quite what to do
it seemed like the world was crying too"
834,goin' back,dusty springfield,Folk,"i think i'm goin' back
to the things i learned so well in my youth
i think i'm returning to
those days when i was young enough to know the truth

now there are no games
to only pass the time
no more coloring books
no christmas bells to chime
but thinking young and growing older is no sin
and i can play the game of life to win

i can recall a time,
when i wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend
and now i think i've got
a lot more than a skipping rope to lift

now there's more to do
than watch my sailboat glide
and everyday can be my magic carpet ride
and i can play hide and seek with my fears
and live my days instead of counting my years

let everyone debate the true reality,
i'd rather see the world the way it used to be
a little bit of freedom's all we're lack
so catch me if you can
i'm goin' back"
835,golden apples of the sun,judy collins,Folk,"i went out to the hazelwood
because a fire was in my head
cut and peeled a hazel wand
and hooked a berry to a thread

and when white moths were on the wing
and moth-like stars were flickering out
i dropped the berry in a stream
and caught a little silver trout

when i had laid it on the ground
and gone to blow the fire aflame
something rustled on the floor
and someone called me by my name

it had become a glimmering girl
with apple blossom in her hair
who called me by my name and ran
and vanished in the brightening air

though i am old with wandering
through hollow lands and hilly lands
i will find out where she has gone
and see her lips and take her hand

and walk through long green dappled grass
and pluck till time and times are done
the silver apples of the moon
the golden apples of the sun"
836,basin street blues,bob wills,Folk,"won't you come along with me
to the mississippi
we'll take a boat to the land of dreams
steam down the river, down to new orleans

the band's there to meet us
old friends there to greet us
where all the proud and elite folks meet
heaven on earth, they call it basin street

basin street is the street
where the best folks always meet
in new orleans, land of dreams
you'll never know how nice it seems,
or just how much it really means

glad to be, oh yes-sirree
where welcome's free and dear to me

838,fare thee well,marianne faithfull,Folk,"oh, fare thee well, i must be gone
and leave you for a while.
if ever i go i will return
if i go ten thousand miles.

if i go
if i go
if i go ten thousand miles.

ten thousand miles it is so far
to leave me here alone
while i may lie lament and cry
and you'll not hear my moan.

and you
no, you
and you'll not hear my moan.

the crow that is so black, my love,
will change its colour white.
if i ever should prove false to thee
the day will turn to night.

oh the day
yes, the day
oh the day will turn to night.

the rivers never will run dry
or the rocks melt with the sun.
i'll never prove false to the boy i love

839,hallelujah,brandi carlile,Folk,"now, i've heard there was a secret chord
that david played, and it pleased the lord
but you don't really care for music, do ya?
it goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
the minor fall, the major lift
the baffled king composing hallelujah

[chorus]
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah

your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her bathing on the roof
her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
she tied you to her kitchen chair
she broke your throne, and she cut your hair
and from your lips she drew the hallelujah

[chorus]

well baby, i've been here before
i've seen this room and i've walked this floor
you know, i used to live alone before i knew ya
and i've seen your flag on the marble arch
and love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

[chorus]

well, there was a time when you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show that to me, do ya?
but remember when i moved in you
and the holy dove was moving too
and every breath we drew was hallelujah

[chorus]

maybe there is a god above
but all i've ever learned from love
was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

[chorus]

hallelujah , hallelujah"
840,you can't buy love,judy collins,Folk,"oh...
oh...

you can buy most anything out there on the street
some things cost a fortune, gems and jewels so sweet

you can buy a ticket on a supersonic plane 

you can buy umbrellas for the falling rain
you can buy your pleasure
you can buy your pain

pearls and diamond earrings, caviar by the pound
some can buy a country, some can buy a town

but you can't buy love
no you can't buy love
but you can't buy love
love is not for sale

oh
oh

you can buy a mansion furnish it with silk
you can buy a picasso, antiques to the hilt

you can buy a galleon, sail it on the sea
you can be a pirate, think you live for free

but you can't buy love
no you can't buy love
but you can't buy love
love is not for sale

you can buy a ticket on a supersonic plane 

you can't buy your freedom, but you can buy your chains

you can buy me presents, you can take my time
you can buy me something to make me think i 'm fine

but you can't buy love
no you can't buy love
but you can't buy love
love is not for sale

london stones, hard and cold
when you're up in the morning early
here's my babes to catch your eye
sick they are, no wonder why
hard heart, you pass me by
up in the morning early
the party rings with merriment and laughter
locked outside are we for ever after
singing hope and glory, glory
lords, commons, ministries
thought you'd seen the last of me
no such thing as poverty
wealth for all and liberty
youth and gold, how they shine
bright toys they make you blind
out of sight and out of mind
are the beggars up so early
through the night we fall without a number
'round your door in rags and bags we slumber
singing hope and glory, glory
kind soul, kind soul, pennies for my begging bowl
london stones, hard and cold
up in the morning early
when you're up in the morning early"

it seems you never do get home
i fall asleep at the break of day
just to drive these awful blues away
 
wake up sweetheart the night has passed 
you slept your troubles all away
get ready now to love again
this weary heart you stole away

i heard you crying in your sleep
you said you found somebody new
so i'll live on and just pretend
i could never love no one but you

how can you treat me like you do
you know i've never done you wrong
my heart will always worship you
but still each night i'm left alone"
844,who knows where the time goes,sandy denny,Folk,"across the evening sky, all the birds are leaving
but how can they know it's time for them to go?
before the winter fire, i will still be dreaming
i have no thought of time

for who knows where the time goes?
who knows where the time goes?

sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
ah, but then you know it's time for them to go
but i will still be here, i have no thought of leaving
i do not count the time

for who knows where the time goes?
who knows where the time goes?

and i am not alone while my love is near me
i know it will be so until it's time to go
so come the storms of winter and then the birds in spring again
i have no fear of time

for who knows how my love grows?
and who knows where the time goes?"

even shared the tears

i'm having problems dealing with wealth
but you wouldn't understand it, until you get a million yourself
you niggaz must've got a deal for your health
your cd is frozen food, it just chills on the shelf
i spend big, at any time i can start splurging

i got a new polished look
and twenty dime bitches, to show y'all niggaz how my two dollars look
the boy's got at least six digits on

all they do is complain what they expect from me y'all
from the hood to hollywood they respecting me y'all
and even overseas they accepting me y'all
all the ladies show me love, the thugs repping me y'all
i get a lot of dirty money so respect me or fall

you can't name another cat that can mess with me y'all
at the shows all the hoes be molesting me y'all
i got broads crying trying to get next to me y'all
i got broads craving begging to have sex with me y'all
screaming, ""cash you don't know how sexy you are!""
and i'm happy i'm alive, god's blessing me y'all
and all the problems that arrive is god testing me y'all

cause the folks you call friends can envy the most
some cats'll hang themselves if you give 'em a rope
burn the bridge and don't give a boat, let 'em sink
sometimes you gotta give 'em some some time to let 'em think
but sometimes you gotta give 'em the nine and let 'em stink

i'd rather keep my eyes wide open instead of blink
as soon as your eyes shut, them niggaz will ride up
and the guys that you trusted be getting you tied up
and we all gotta die, but i ain't ready to leave

jesse the stairs in the halls, recalling
your step; and i remember too.

do you think that we will go there,
and see what makes it shine, mary margaret?
it's almost morning, and we've talked all night,
you know we've made big plans for ten-year-olds,
you and i.

have you met my new boy friend, margaret?
his name is john, and he rides my bus to school,
and he holds my hand.
he's fourteen, he's my older man.
but we'll still be the best of friends,
the three of us, margaret, john, and i.

let's go to new york city, margaret!
we'll hide out in the subways
and drink the poets' wine, oh,
but i had john, so you went and i stayed behind.
but you were home in time for the senior prom,
when we lost john.

the fantasies we plan, i'm living them now.
all the dreams we sang when we knew how,
well, they haven't changed.
there's never been two friends like you and me,
mary margaret.

it's nice to see you family growing, margaret.
your daughter and your husband there,
they really treat you right...
but we've talked all night
and what about the light, that glowed beyond
our woods when we were ten?
you were the rambler then.

the fantasies we planned, well, maggie,
i'm living them now.
all the dreams we sang, oh, we damn sure knew
how, but i haven't changed.
there'll never be two friends like you and me,

the cold stone face of morning
setting in on me
it's a strange world
it's a very strange world
that leaves me holding on
to nothing when there's nothing
left to lose
your touch is cold and damp
the devil's in your eyes
i wonder why i always
let you lead me on this way
'cause you see only
what you want to see
feel only as you want to
and i am on the outside
of your strange world
it's a strange world
it's a very strange world
that leaves me holding on
to nothing when there's nothing
left to lose
we're walking hand in hand
we'll walk this way forever
our eyes have risen to the water's edge
watching with the tides
the stars have fallen
to another day
and the sun warms our path to find
that reason leaves us far behind
in this strange world

i could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind

you've got reasons a-plenty for going,
this i know, this i know.
for the weeds have been steadily growing,
please don't go, please don't go.

hidden away at the back of the drawer
here's the life that you led before
old photographs of the life you led
arm in arm with mr x y and z
old boyfriends big and small
got to see how i measure up to them all
there is a place we all must start, love
who were you holding in that fond embrace
i've found a door into your heart, love
and do you still feel the warmth of cold kisses
here i am behind enemy lines
looking for secrets, looking for signs
old boyfriends big and small
got to see how i measure up to them all
this one's handsome, not too bright
this one's clever with his hands alright
tougher than me if it came to a fight
and this one's a poet, a bit of a wet
bit of a gypsy, a bit of a threat
i wonder if she's got over him yet
old passions frozen in the second
who were you holding in that fond embrace
hearts have a past that must be reckoned
and do you still feel the warmth of cold kisses
time to put the past away
that's your footstep in the street i'd say
tie the ribbon back around it
everything just the way i found it
and i can hear you turn the key
and my head's buried when you see me
in a margaret miller mystery
and do you still feel the warmth of cold kisses
do you still feel the warmth of cold kisses"

hadn't seen my uncle now since i was seventeen
and the stories of the wild, wild west kept comin' back to me
he didn't say too much, just tipped his has as he closed the old truck door
and i knew that this trip down highway 10 would bring me so much more
where the old man and the little boy could see things eye to eye
he took me back to a place in time where legends never die...
his hands and face were lined and weathered, they told stories of their own
his skin as red as desert clay, his eyes as black as coal
he was a cowboy and an indian, just a little bit of both
for years of working the ranches and rodeos he didn't have much to show
then he closed his eyes and spoke to me, his voice was like the wind

did you reach too high and fall
and there is no rest for the ones god blessed

they've seen that much that soon
your cheek too cold, too pale to shine
like an old and waning moon
and there is no peace, no true release
no secret place to crawl
and there is no rest for the ones god blessed
and he blessed you best of all
if tears unshed could heal your heart
if words unsaid could sway
then watch you melt into the night
adieu, and rue the day

did you reach too high and fall

he's still got that arrowhead we found when we were kids
and i knew we would be like brothers, well just as long as we both lived
i still got my memories of the night we jumped the fence
stole you uncle's pickup truck, drove it up around the bend
you were the handsome cowboy, i the trusty brave
we were looking for some fallen angel waiting to be saved
well for some it just comes so easy
for others seems its bread in the bones
but we danced to the beat of a different drum
then the one we heard at home
i went to the mountains, i was reaching for the sun
i was on fire for leaving, this angry battle i thought i'd won
david dug his trenches, he fought his war at home
my mountain soon was crumbling, god i was all alone
well for some it just comes so easy
and for others its bread in their bones
but i danced to the beat of a different drum
then the one i heard at home
it was years before the smoke cleared, i could come back home again
look my father in the eyes, i could finally let him in
for he was not the enemy, no the enemy was within
and i knew the day they understood because david was my friend
well for some you know it comes so easy
and for others seems its bread in their bones
but i still danced to the beat of a different drum
then the one i heard at home
i will always dance to the beat of a different drum
for the warrior has come home"
880,surface,mindy smith,Folk,"everybody's searching
trying to find a reason to live in this world of fallen kingdoms
looking for a little truth
'cause maybe just a little truth will get us through
so you find yourself believing
you can jump into the deep end and still survive
still survive
but you're coming to the surface
getting back in focus
bound to find your way back home
everybody's searching on

the devil's so deceiving
you can almost hear him creeping
around your soul and trying his best to keep you from the truth
'cause he knows a little truth will get you through
so you hide there in the trenches
building up defenses to survive
just survive

but you're coming to the surface
getting back in focus
determined you can get back home
everybody's searching on

life's hard
why do we make it so hard
it's already hard

coming to the surface
getting back in focus
determined you can get back home

the letters that i sent.
but now you've got the gist
of what my letters meant.
you're reading them again,
the ones you didn't burn.
you press them to your lips,
my pages of concern.
i said there'd been a flood.
i said there's nothing left.
i hoped that you would come.
i gave you my address.
your story was so long,
the plot was so intense,
it took you years to cross
the lines of self-defense.
the wounded forms appear:
the loss, the full extent;
and simple kindness here,
the solitude of strength.
you walk into my room.
you stand there at my desk,
begin your letter to
the one who's coming next."

blow my engine steam at your glowin' dreams
so honey won't you let me in, oh

888,love in a memory,nanci griffith,Folk,"she sleeps alone in the warm nights of memphis
where the peabody hotel meets the velveteen sky
she sings like the waves in the cool mississippi
that brought her from st. paul in '75
and men come to court her with roses and sweet wine
where hands cross the ivories from six until nine
she sings away sorrow each night when she leaves him
she goes home alone,
she's not the marrying kind

[chorus:]
love is a memory that she'll always hold
cause love in a memory never grows old
why she did leave him, well nobody knows
love in a memory never grows old

now he works the toll booth on the new jersey turnpike
the ring on his finger grows cold to the bone
his sons were all dreamers who cheat on their own wives
he still dreams of st. paul when he's cheating alone

teaching the past, through a rose coloured glass
said the fenix will rise, from the ashes at last

on streets paved with gold, where we'll never grow old
and old glass houses and ivory towers
are not what they seem, they're fragile as dreams

and oh, seventy-one
they were handin' out boots and guns to some mother's son
but seventy-eight, they said sorry, but we made a mistake
time for some fun, ooh ain't life grea-eat

in tall glass houses with ivory towers
the beaches are gold and we'll never grow old
and old glass houses, ivory towers
there fragile as dreams, but never what they see-eem

you know, now-a-days, you go to town
there's glass all arou-ound
and they're still building towers
and they're buried deep in the grou-ou-ou-ou-ound
a travesty, starin' at me-ee

trying to stay ahead a morning as time came running with us
and she beat us to the finish as we ran through the fields
you were born in the city and you didn't recognize me

your beauty unexpected like a flower in the concrete
some gods far below the worlds undiscovered
set you up to ruin temples to find me on the streets
i'm an alias of who i am a counterfeited fake

in the picture i am kneeling like a dying saint jerome
hurling rocks at the demons who tried to come too near
till you came in and possessed me now i feel at home

i remember the time i walked for seven hours
and thought about the people i had known for so long
all the castles i had built of of fine and precious sand
till you came in like the tide now i don't care that they are gone

as we floated up the river i translated the verses
that were written on memorials for the ships that had sank
and i thought about the people that traded sinking for uncertainty
and drowned because of loneliness before they reached the banks

on a beach near barcelona the young girls cry for mary
and they bury earthen vessels in the rocks by the sea
i am sending out a bottle with a prayer upon the waves
that you'll find inside my picture and your memory will unfold me
we were talking about a trip that i had taken to the canyons

and you told me of a river that had cut through time
leaving only the pictures of long dead sons and daughters
and you told that the paintings looked a lot like mine
i try and watch myself to see what i am saying

but my heart is on my collar and i'm asking you to take it
i don't want to go back to the way things were before
before the dawn turns into morning i want you there to break it
and a thousand years from now when our names are just a memory
and poets have recorded what happened in the past

lovers loving in the night will find our forms in constellations
seekers seeking for salvation will find our stories in the stained glass
a boy in the city who has never seen the morning
as he's running arm in arm with you through the fields
will be caught unexpected by a flower in the concrete
it will all return again just like a potter's wheel"

i've looked at clouds from both sides now
from up and down and still somehow
it's cloud's illusions i recall
i really don't know clouds at all

moons and junes and ferris wheels the dizzy dancing way you feel
when every fairy tale comes real, i've looked at love that way
but now it's just another show, you leave 'em laughin' when you go
and if you care don't let them know, don't give yourself away

i've looked at love from both sides now 
from win and lose and still somehow
it's love's illusions i recall
i really don't know love at all

tears and fears and feeling proud, to say, ""i love you"" right out loud
schemes and dreams and circus crowds, i've looked at life that way
but now old friends are acting strange, they shake their heads,
they say i've changed
but something's lost but something's gained in living every day

i've looked at life from both sides now
from give and take and still somehow
it's life's illusions i recall
i really don't know life at all"

and thanks the lord he lives a cotton field away

if we could see beyond the clouds
we both might be on common ground

we met in school by court's decree
i learned real soon, you were a lot like me
across the land they say things have changed
but still we stand a cotton field away
still we stand a cotton field away

across the land they say things have changed
but still we stand a cotton field away

"
906,that year,brandi carlile,Folk,"i must have been sleeping, i must have been drinking,
i haven't been dreaming about you for years. there was a sharp
turn and a sunburn i was too cool for high school that year.

must have have been new years. no one invited you, 
took things too far but i missed you and your antics. 
you were lonesome and blue-eyed and so special to us.

you could have taken a long break 
instead of a long drop from a high place. 
ten years i never spoke your name. 
now it feels good to say it. your my friend again.

said he forgave you, i said i hated you, 
he was the bigger man, i was sixteen. 
all the innocence it took well i guess 
you finally made the year book. 
that year. 
that year.

you should have taken a long break instead of a long drop, 
instead of a leap of faith, ten years i never spoke your name. 
now it feels good to say that your my friend again. 
your my friend again.

i was angry, i was a baptist, i was a daughter, i was wrong."
907,everybody,little wings,Folk,"then, (ida?) break the spell of change,
and so to duly rearrange,
the faces that you've seen before.
and, let the will of absence pour.

the gravity will keep you near,
inside its arms that are so clear that
you may never even see them, but
realize everything could be them.

up and down your chest will rise.
there's no invisible disguise.
your face is open sky sometimes.
your chest a forest grown inside.

feed it, let it grow, and replicate.
the universe, you know it has no weight.
it waits for magnets, waits for gravity.
so i know everything i have was sent for me.

unwrap it all and skin me.
climb on all the branches in me.
look through light and see me in it.
name the game so we can win it.

and, everything, oh everything,
in your cloaks you go,
disguising what you work through,
talking to me as i go.

and, become my life, become my time.
become that year that's never mine.
let that come through, let glory shine.
grow up and feel the change inside.

expand, expand like land horizon.
sponge and water soak the skies.
intake through what brought you by breathing
life into the life you're leading.

first came dust and light,
so it's late at night,
and i can see the first thing in your
headlights while we drive.

and we pull over.
i am sober.
my face looks older.
you touch my shoulder.

now you've seen me.
now i've seen you.
now we try somehow to share the time
that we've been through.

and, i could feel the brains were born anew,
anew by light of morning, walking
in the skin that grew.
it grew me and i grew it too.

it knew me and i knew it too.
and no one feels the day go through
exactly in the way i do.
that's what makes me, me, and you, you.

and i can be what makes me.
and you won't be what breaks me.
and i can wait for all that wakes me,
in the way i've always done.

i'm finding out what chose me,
how to use the hand that rose me,
how to sing the word that woes me.
in a way i've just begun.

in a way i've just begun unravelling
this costume at the seams that i design.
i know it inside out.
i know that you attend may bring.

but whenever i am here,
i am aware of everything.

i'm something i can understand.
i am the sky, i am the land.
i am the foot, i am the hand.
i am the wave headed for sand.
i am the cattle and the brand.
i am the souvenir stand.
i am the hometown, local band.
i am the mic, i am the stand,
i'm everybody."
908,morning sun,marianne faithfull,Folk,"i see the morning sun
coming over the hill,
sorrow and pain for me
coming over the hill.
i'm very sad
lost love for me
but i will love again.
i know a man
who breaks every heart that he can.
i know him well
for i have been hurt by this man.
i'm very sad,
tears follow me,
but i will love again.
i'm very sad,
tears follow me,
but i will love again.
i know a man
who promises that he'll be true
and i look back once again,
well, what else could i do ?
i'm very sad
but he is true
and we will love again.
i see the morning sun
coming over the hill.
i see him and he says
that he'll stay
and he will.
i'm sad no more,
he comforts me."
909,sulk,billy bragg,Folk,"if you hate me, why don't you go?
and if you love me, why don't you let me know?
but you just won't give me an inch, so
you just sulk

why do i want to hide whenever you show up?
you know your moods just make me want to throw up
why don't you just bloody well grow up?
you just sulk

all of the time,
why don't you pick me up or throw me a line?
all over the place,
why don't you tell me what you think?
come on and tell me to my face

if you love me, why don't you show it?
if you hate me, why don't you let me know it?
why don't you just pick up something and throw it?
you just sulk

if you want to bend my arm,
well you could do it with a little more charm,
but you just couldn't bear to do me any harm
so you just sulk

and you tell me that you want to quit
and then you treat me like a piece of shit
and when i ask you, what's that got to do with it?
you just sulk"
910,the sun always reminds me of you,marissa nadler,Folk,"it's a beautiful day
and i went for a walk
but i saw that old dirt path
where we used to talk
where is the rain
cause some spring lovers
are bringing me down again

the years have come
and your hands have gone
but your land is something
lost in a song

why does the sun always remind me of you
yes it does
i hope a new day will come
and cover up what i done

why does the sun always remind me of you
i would know
that there ain't nothing but love songs
on the radio

turn on the colored days
to peel away the skin
the sun will turn my hands to gold
more than any alchemist

sea water it rounds the edge of shard and turns to sand
i heard you bought a house

and light it up with glass and second hand

why does the sun always remind me of you
yes it does
i hope a new day will come
and cover up what i have done
why does the sun always remind me of you
i would know
that there aint nothing but love songs
on the radio

always reminds me of you
yes it does
it always reminds me of you
yes it does, 
yes it does, 
yes it does

why does the sun always remind me of you
i hope a new day will come
and cover up what i have done

911,why do you turn your back?,richard thompson,Folk,"when you were helpless, before you knew
he gave you shelter until you grew
he kept you secret, then he gave you a name
you drank from a river, you slept in the hay
you grew up running, into the wind
you grew up fighting a war you'd never win
against a foe you'd never seen
pretending to be what you'd never been
why do you turn your back on your best friend?
why do you turn your back on the one who loves you?
why do you turn your back on your best friend?
the only one who ever really cared
the only one who ever really cared
when you were burning, the sky would pour
when you were drowning, he threw you ashore
he saved your life, o just to be
the one who turned back his enemy
and now you're like a bolted door
no-one can change the lock, your palace is secure
you're the king and the prisoner
but don't you hear the knocking at the door?
why do you turn your back on your best friend?
why do you turn your back on the one who loves you?
why do you turn your back on your best friend?
the only one who ever really cared
the only one who ever really cared
and now you falter, afraid to live
and now you hold back, afraid to be the giver
and do you ever think
of the friend who gave you gifts like a river?
why do you turn your back on your best friend?
why do you turn your back on the one who loves you?
why do you turn your back on your best friend?
the only one who ever really cared
the only one who ever really cared
why do you turn your back on your best friend?"

forefathers where are you now?

independence day, i never knew it would be so symbolic.

what if i said i loved you
and i needed your guidance to help me through the obstacles?
would you say i am too wordy and then, then would you laugh?
what if i said i'm under glass untouchable as the document itself?
would you say ok,
and that you never even considered me?

oh independence day, yes independence,

913,bonita and bill butler,alison krauss,Folk,"i grew up in the scantling yards of wheeling west virginia
a wheelhouse cub looking for an open door
in the packet ways a sweeney wed the keel of my bonita
just two months from her timbers til she moored
i paid the fare in billet on her maiden voyage to vicksburg
and talked my way to hand the tiller on the course
in her planks i carved a notch and sealed the vow ""be my bonita""
and her dowry was my life between the shores
i was born with rouging ways
and she steered me like a woman
from the port calls and the bawds that lead me stray
the calliope serenades
made the old towns come running
and the boys would gamble shards to pull her chains
the striker's boast would fain me loss
about the wrecks the shoals were keeping
and how the old girl's got poor billy's ransom saved
on the lake at bistineau
she set the wharf at dixie
with a thousand bales of cotton on her main
as the great raft disappeared
the watermark went sinking
and she was stuck right hard
a listing on the bank
with the furnace still a blaze
i stood my last upon her
then climbed the prow and took a landsman's trade
""a derelict now milady"" said the watch log i've concorded
""have the bosun sound us eight bells for the change""
cause i was born with rouging ways
and she steered me like a woman
from the port calls and the bawds that lead me stray
the calliope serenades
made the old towns come running
and the boys would gamble shards to pull her chains
and i would take to wider walks
so the gin i stopped a drinking
at three scores aloft this crooked frame

about the wrecks the shoals were keeping

926,the dry cleaner from des moines,joni mitchell,Folk,"words by joni mitchell
music by charles mingus
i'm down to a roll of dimes
i'm stalking the slot that's hot
i keep hearing bells all around me
jingling in the lucky jackpots
they keep you tantalized
they keep you reaching for your wallet
here in fools' paradise!
i talked to a cat from des moines
he said he ran a cleaning plant
that cat was clanking with coin
well, he must have had a genie in a lamp
'cause every time--i dropped a dime--i blew it
he kept ringing bells
nothing to it!
he got three oranges
three lemons
three cherries
three plums
i'm losing my taste for fruit
watching the dry cleaner do it
like midas in a polyester suit
it's all luck!
it's just luck!
you get a little lucky and you make a little money!
i followed him down the strip
he picked out a booth at circus circus
where the cowgirls fill the room
with their big balloons
the cleaner was pitching with purpose!
he had dinos and pooh bears
and lions--pink and blue there
he couldn't lose there!
des moines was stacking the chips
raking off the tables
ringing the bandit's bells
this is a story that's a drag to tell
(in some ways)
since i lost every dime
i laid on the line
but the cleaner from des moines
could put a coin
in the door of a john
and get twenty for one
it's just luck!."

followed the pretty words, slept in tangled sheets
but there is no cure across the sea
no there's no one here but me

and all the while, i've been wasting time
putting the miles in an uphill climb
chasing the smiles of the satisfied
on the other side

he was the poet king, he was the promised land
he was the solid rock, he was the shifting sand
and the only thing that's guaranteed
is there's no one here but me

and all the while, i've been wasting time
putting the miles in an uphill climb
chasing the smiles of the satisfied
on the other side

wringing the tears from a perfect day
chasing the ghost of a paradigm
from another time

so now there's no one to measure the size of my dreams
no one to tell me how crazy they seem
no one to tell me the way it ought to be
i get to write my history, i get to tell it like i see it

930,the irish rover,tommy makem,Folk,"in the year of our lord, eighteen hundred and six,
we set sail from the coal quay of cork
we were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
for the grand city hall in new york
we'd an elegant craft, it was rigged 'fore and aft
and how the trade winds drove her
she had twenty-three masts and she stood several blasts
and they called her the irish rover

there was barney magee from the banks of the lee
there was hogan from county tyrone
there was johnny mcgurk who was scared stiff of work
and a chap from westmeath named malone
there was slugger o'toole who was drunk as a rule
and fighting bill tracy from dover
and your man mick mccann, from the banks of the bann
was the skipper on the irish rover

we had one million bags of the best sligo rags
we had two million barrells of bone
we had three million bales of old nanny goats' tails
we had four million barrells of stone
we had five million hogs and six million dogs
and seven million barrells of porter
we had eight million sides of old blind horses' hides
in the hold of the irish rover

we had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
and our ship lost her way in a fog
and the whole of the crew was reduced down to two
'twas myself and the captain's old dog
then the ship struck a rock, oh, lord what a shock
and nearly tumbled over

the grass is growing green;
many a cold and winter night that i alone have been. it is a cold and cruel night when i must lie alone
the bonny boy is young
but he is growing. oh! father
dear father i think you done me wrong
to go and get me married to one who is so young. for he is only sixteen years and i am twenty-one. the bonny boy is young but he's growing. oh! daughter
dear daughter
i did not do you wrong
for i have married you to a rich man's son
and he shall be a match for thee when i am dead and gone. he is young
but he is daily growing. oh! father
dear father
i'll tell you what i'll do;
i'll send the boy to college for another year or two;
and all around his college cap
i'll bind a ribbon blue
for to let the ladies know that he's married. a year it went by and i passed the college wall
and saw the young collegians a-playing at the ball;
amidst them was my own true love
the fairest of them all
he was young but he was daily growing. at the age of sixteen he was a married man
and at the age of seventeen he was the father of a son
at the age of eighteen
his grave had all grown green;
and the death put an end to his growing. i'll make my love a shroud of ornamental brown;
and whilst i am a making it
the tears they will run down;
for once i had my own love
now he's lying low
and i'll nurse his bonny boy while he's growing."

from the start most every heart that's been broken
was because there always was a man to blame.

956,the internationale,billy bragg,Folk,"stand up all victims of oppression
for the tyrants fear your might
don't cling so hard to your possessions
for you have nothing if you have no rights
let racist ignorance be ended
for respect makes the empires fall
freedom is merely privilege extended
unless enjoyed by one and all

[chorus]
so come brothers and sisters
for the struggle carries on
the internationale
unites the world in song
so comrades come rally
for this is the time and place
the international ideal
unites the human race

let no one build walls to divide us
walls of hatred nor walls of stone
come greet the dawn and stand beside us
we'll live together or we'll die alone
in our world poisoned by exploitation
those who have taken now they must give
and end the vanity of nations
we've but one earth on which to live

and so begins the final drama
in the streets and in the fields
we stand unbowed before their armor
we defy their guns and shields
when we fight provoked by their aggression
let us be inspired by like and love
for though they offer us concessions
change will not come from above"

i laughed so hard i fell down
i cursed these lanes i walked on

i am mine

so i sailed my ship of dreams
somewhere else at sea
and i aimed at her on an ocean
a frivol silver scheme
impossible promises
to the live machine
i found a safe harbor
to find me a home
to raise a family
and oh god!
even my children will probably
grow up wrong
somehow i have forgotten the ways
of flying back to you again
'cause i searched the sky along the ways
and i catch the last london train
i see the wolves upon the snow
and the beaches at low tide
i've been to france and offered thanks
'cause on my own two feet i died
i slept by your naked body
my mind all on the sea
and i touched your lips of violet
and your hair of barbery

no i won't cry for dreams that couldn't be
no i won't cry
the daffodils the sorry candlelight
to buy my heart when loveless words were spoken
too many tears to welcome in the night
too many promises the days have broken
so i won't cry for kisses out of reach
no i won't cry iâ€™ll practice what i preach
and i won't cry
no flowers now no silly candle games
somehow my feet won't lead me to the doorway
and so i stand and wonder who's to blame
waiting for one last word that calls to beg me stay
but i won't cry if that world never comes
no i won't cry for now the story's done
and i won't cryâ€¦goodbye."

the comfort in the sound of a lullaby,
the innocence of leaves in the spring,

comes soaking through the cardboard in my shoes,
where the promised land might be a place
where a man could find free cigarettes and booze,
and the alleyways full of ragged strays,
the doorway wine i tell my troubles to,
i remember all these things,

i can't go home, i'm in some kind of trouble
what started so innocently turned to sin
i can't get out, i am too deep in

have you ever had everything you'd ever wanted
a good life, good friends and a loving companion
take a hard look and pay real close attention
i threw it all away with reckless abandon
on a pair of caramel eyes
i found out how quickly i learned to lie
don't judge me 'til you've walked a mile in my shoes
things aren't always as they seem
being with him was like falling asleep
going home was like waking from some kind of dream
the kind that you hope never ends
but real life is not something i can suspend"

i'll just be quiet when i get angry and hurt
i'm stopping traffic, cinemagraphic
with my long black coat hanging down in the dirt
and my hair clinging to my face in the rain
like a goddess from the cult of beautiful pain 

i don't want to be another mystery 
i don't want to be another mystery 

i could cut you off with a shoulder of stone
smoke all night and leave the party alone
screw myself with an inscrutable pout

and suddenly i knew you all my life.

don't we have all that time: treasure that's yours and mine, and a place that we call home
don't we have photographs taken a long time back
of the seasons we have known?

i know it's strange to say, when we just met this way, but i look into your eyes,

before the chance is gone,
so at least i won't be wondering
the rest of my life long."

you saw their shocked and gaping jaws then it all returned to black.
there was a brief surge of panic, their eyes pressed tight.
you brought a swarm of confusion to their bleak but simple lives.

cognitive suicide. insular, pathetic minds
try to cut you off at the knees so they won't be left behind.
if everything is bland and unambiguous,
maybe they can understand how they fit into this place.

every time they fail they seek a victim for their spite.
some dismal need to crush someone beneath their feet.
all their acrid words can't ease their wounded hearts.
despite their claims they have no maps, no keys to any gates.

cognitive suicide. insecure, regressive minds
try to cut you off at the knees so they won't be left behind.

petrified, frozen to imaginary times.
pay no mind, i hope they pass you by.
live your life and don't apologize
to the cowards of this world, they're a waste of time.

are they terrified of unobscured and brilliant colours?
perhaps you cracked the door to their own forbidden worlds.

well it's many a man that i've seen in my day
(uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded)
like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
a man will have lust for the lure of the mine

a long dark winter passed us by
with shooting stars and hopeful hearts, our worlds collide
and so we rushed to fill each other in
quick to feed our hungry hopes
a feast of our affections, we were born anew
with open eyes we tried to make it work
and for a while the magic took
but cracks began to show as soon as things got hard
like paper walls our feelings tore
we threw our backs against the door
unwilling to bear witness to the other side
oh, the games we play to hide, the tangled dread inside
the fear that we are going nowhere fast
i point the finger out, the anger gets so loud
it drowns out all the sorrow, at least until tomorrow...what then?
i took a good hard look at how i loved
years i squandered falling fast
for any boy who'd have me was so insecure
i'd lie awake alone at night
full of loathing, compromised
and wondering how the hell did i end up like this
oh, the tears of rage i cried, when nowhere could i find
an answer that made any kind of sense to me
i point the finger out, the anger gets so loud
it drowns out all the sorrow, at least until tomorrow...

1007,the butterfly,celtic woman,Folk,"this evening the moon dreams more lazily as some fair woman, lost in cushions deep with gentle hand caresses listlessly the contour of her breasts before she sleeps on velvet backs of avalanches soft she often lies enraptured as she dies and gazes on white visions aloft which like a blossoming to heaven rise when sometimes on this globe, in indolence she lets a secret tear drop down, by chance a poet, set against oblivion takes in his hand this pale and furtive tear this opal drop where rainbow hues appear and hides it in his breast far from the sun"
1008,larry the polar bear,fred small,Folk,"in nineteen thirty-who at a zoo in los angeles
a polar bear named larry performed for the crowd,
they'd cheer aloud
he'd go slipping and sliding, jumping and diving
the people would laugh. they took his photograph.
larry was born at the zoo
he never knew as he grew older
anything colder
than los angeles
which is warmer than alaska
where larry's parents were born.
chorus:
larry the polar bear
he'd never harm a hair on a child's head
he'd do tricks for them
at the los angeles zoo,
as he'd been taught to by his keeper fran.
fran would teach him new tricks
a funny pose
scratching his nose
he knew there'd be a fish at the end,
fran was his friend.
one day she said ""larry, you'll be in the movies
with real movie stars and a few simple tricks
and lots of fish
to be filmed on location in alaska.""
and so they rehearsed for larry's big scene,
he's supposed to be mean
and growl at a woman who was rescued by a man who scared him away
it was stupid
but fun to do.
the director would frown
and jump up and down
kind of like the chimps at the zoo.
chorus
at last came the day of the trip
they put larry in a crate
twelve foot by eight
and he sailed aboard a steamship
the journey was long
and boring
fran would visit
she'd talk to him
and bring him his favorite fish
then the noise and the rumbling stopped
and they lowered him down
set the crate on the frozen ground
and opened it
fran said ""larry, we're here
it's time for your tricks.""
and larry appeared
he looked out at the gray bering sea
he squinted and puzzled
put his nose to the wind
and the scent of the seal made him tremble
he smelled the fox in its lair
and the weasel and hare
felt lichen and snow 'neath his paws,
and he looked at the tundra and ice,
looked at the loon in the sky and he ran
slowly at first
kind of lumbering
he ran
gathering speed
gathering memories from within
old and dim
growing stronger
to run and to swim,
to dive and to float,
the cold at his throat
but warm inside
'neath the fur and hide
ocean and ice all around him
he ran
he ran
he ran
and he swam away.

gotten to, gotten to

she's gotten to mysterious devotions
she's gotten to the zodiac and zen
she's gotten into tarot cards and potions
she's laying her religion on her friends
on her friends, on her friends

friends who come to ask her for their future
friends who come to find they can't be friends
because of signs and seasons that don't suit her
she'll prophesy your death, she won't say when
won't say when, won't say when

when all the black cards come you cannot barter
no, when all your stars are stacked you cannot win
she'll shake her head and treat you like a martyr
it is her blackest spell she puts you in
puts you in, puts you in

in sorrow she can lure you where she wants you
inside your own self-pity there you swim
in sinking down to drown her voice still haunts you
and only with your laughter can you win
can you win, can you win

you win the lasting laurels with your laughter
it reaches like an arm before you sink
to win the solitary truth you're after
you dare not ask the priestess how to think
how to think, how to think

missing pages i cannot seem to find

in my memory
is in a folded hand of grace against these times

no one's ever come between your memory and me

will you still find me if i leave you here beside this road
cause i need someone who can touch me
who'll put no one above me
someone who needs me
like the air he breathes

maybe it's fort worth, maybe it's a heart of gold
the price of love is such a heavy toll
that i've lived my life in the back roads
with your love in my pocket
if i spend the love you gave me
tell me where will it go?

ever thought of staying solo
if she thought of other men and
if she doubted john lennon

giving john her music lessons
challenging the warring nations
with her paper installations
did she guard her yoko human heart 

well, they could talk about me
yeah, they could talk about me
throw me to the velvet dogs of pop star history
but i won't be your yoko ono
if you're not good enough for me 

some will give their love for fashion
others trade their gold for passion
i don't have the goods to start with
never had the reins to part with
still, i hope you take me seriously 

'cause i think i could go
deep as the sea of yoko
you don't know a person like me
i could sell your songs to nike
and for all you know
i could save your soul 
as only true love can change your mind
make you leave your screaming fans behind

when john called the wind an opera
making love with every chakra
when he said her voice would carry
and when he whispered old chuck berry
only then would yoko set him free 

fame will come and vanish later
transcendental love is greater
i think if we had this somehow
we'd be feeling famous right now
we'd be saying love is all you need 

and they could rag about me
yeah, they could rag about me
throw me to the velvet dogs of pop star history

like through accidents within
and telling people lies of
lions, treasures and kings

nothing's more revealing than the dancer and the doubt
waving to forget what's never gone
always there, never rise

and weathered leaves and terraces
the minnows in your pockets win the
rabbits on trails

this is not the future but i sense it's up right up there, oh

another day anywhere

or where you'll be when they find you some

and you know they're always following me
so when i get there you trust me some, sweet

i'll catch 'em

this is where you're passionate of seasons and their strength
and this is where you'll breath and walk and know they will end

there is love, there is rest

my dear little sister i still see her tears
when i had to leave home in our tender years. and my sweet gentle mother
so dear to my heart
it grieved me sincerely when we had to part. said my kind-hearted father as he took my hand: ""as you go in defense of our dear native land
son
be brave but show mercy whenever you can. our hearts will be with you
'til you return again.""

and mrs adlam said, angels stood round our bed.
to keep us safe from dark, right through to day begun,
and we used to lie awake, just to try to see one,
and though we never saw one anywhere,
we heard them softly singing in the air.
sundays occasionally we were invited back for tea,
and bread with jam and cream, made sundays seem a dream.
in the dingy mission hall, mrs adlam praying,

and down the street back home, all our mates were playing,
with mrs adlam's angels everywhere,
and we thought we saw a halo in her hair.
sundays, for sure, ain't like that anymore,
its getting hard for me, to see her face in front of me.
i wonder if her angels have their arms around her curled,
keeping her safe from life, and guarding her from the world.

maybe lay and let your feelings grow accustomed to the dark
and by morning's light, you might solve the problems of the heart
and it all might be a lesson for the hasty heart to know
maybe leavin's not the only way to go

people reach new understandings all the time
they take a second look, maybe change their minds
people reach new understandings everyday
tell me not to reach and i'll go away

nothin' much to look at and there's nothing here to do
just an old newspaper blowin' at my feet
down on main street

old mr. arnold finally sold the store
he started out on main street back before the war
he says business wasn't booming anyway
he says he and that old neighborhood have seen their better day

but he remembers how it was in 1945
when they marched out all the boys who made it home alive
and the girls were throwing roses at their feet
down on main street

down on main street, they're sellin' memories real low
goin' out of business, everything must go

like old forgotten faces without names
the storefronts and the sidewalks and the boarded window frames
and there's the corner record store
where i discovered rock n' roll so many years before

but now i walk these empty streets and i listen for that sound
i listen for the rhythm in the heart of this old town
i listen for the slow and steady beat
down on main street

1044,on to the next,david wilcox,Folk,"someone said it was suicide
his empty chair is all we see
not that anyone knew him well

now they come with the questioning
now they're so sincere
do you remember anything
that he said to you here?

if you get close against the window
you can feel it closer
a trace of a breeze that makes it through
i remember you said
it's almost enough that you could breath it
if you had to that's what i remember most of you

you can hear a pencil drop
and the fluorescent lights
lean forward and keep your answers
out of sight

if you're stuck on a tricky one
if the question's too complex
don't try too figure it out, they say
just move on to the next

who's to blame for a high-school suicide?
ooh, they claim it's the best years of our lives

and the cars on the freeway are whistling by
like a cool goodbye

i've learned my lesson, i've been to school
you were the teacher, i was the fool

well, how do you do it, baby? what is your trick?
you make it look easy, the kiss and the kick
a shrug of the shoulder, a wink of the eye
and a cool goodbye

1051,the heart of the appaloosa,fred small,Folk,"from the land of shooting waters to the peaks of the coeur d'alene
thimbleberries in the forest, elk grazing on the plain
the people of the coyote made their camp along the streams
of the green wallowa valley when fences had no name

and they bred a strain of horses, the treasure of the tribe
who could toe-dance on a ridge or gallop up a mountainside
who could haul the hunter's burden, turn a buffalo stampede
the horse that wore the spotted coat was born with matchless speed

[chorus]
thunder rolling in the mountains
lead the people across the great divide
there's blood on the snow in the hills of idaho
but the heart of the appaloosa never died

in the winter came the crowned ones near frozen in the cold
bringing firearms and spyglasses and a book that saves the soul
the people gave them welcome, nursed them till their strength returned
and studied the talking paper, its mysteries to learn

in the shadow of the mission sprang up farms and squatter towns
the plain was lined with fences, the plow blade split the ground
in the shallows of the clearwater gold glittered in the pan
and the word would come from washington: remove the indian

[chorus]

the chief spoke to the people in his anger and his pain 
""i am no more chief joseph. rolling thunder is my name. 
they condemn us to a wasteland of barren soil and stone 
we shall fight them if we must, but we will find another home.""

they fled into the bitterroot, an army at their heels
they fought at white bird canyon, they fought at misery hill
till the colonel saw his strategy and sent the order down
to kill the appaloosa wherever it be found

[chorus]

twelve hundred miles retreating, three times over the divide
the horse their only safety, their only ally
three thousand appaloosas perishod with the tribe
the people and the horses dying side by side

thunder rolling in the mountains said, ""my heart is sick and sad.
our children now are freezing. the old chiefs are dead.
the hunger take our spirit. our wounds are deep and sore.
from where the sun now stands i shall fight no more.""

[chorus]

they were sent to oklahoma, malaria ran rife
but more died of broken hearts far from the land that gave them life
and the man once called joseph at death was heard to say
""we have given up our horses. they have gone away.""

but sometimes without warning from a dull domestic herd
a spotted horse of spirit wondrous will emerge
strong it is and fearless and nimble on a hill
listening for thunder, the appaloosa's living still

[chorus]"

i asked the caretaker 'cuz he was their maker
he looked at me and laughed took another sip from his glass
he said 'open up your ears and hearts
you put a big bird in a small cage and he'll sing you a song'
that we all love to sing along
to the sound of the bird that mourns
well we rolled into town and the sweet new orleans
to the apple barrel bar it was a hole in the wall
the ceiling weren't tall and the floors filled with grime
but the sound that you would make would just warm their hearts
well it was quarter to 12 and the boys walked in
they got their black suits on and the songs would begin
you open up your ears and hearts
you put a big bird in a small cage and it'll sing you a song

she bought herself a mobile home
so at least she could get some enjoyment
out of being alone
no one could say that she was left up on the shelf
it's you and me against the world kid she mumbled to herself

when the world falls apart some things stay in place
levi stubbs' tears run down his face

she ran away from home on her mother's best coat
she was married before she was even entitled to vote
and her husband was one of those blokes
the sort that only laughs at his own jokes
the sort a war takes away
and when there wasn't a war he left anyway

norman whitfield and barrett strong
are here to make everything right that's wrong
holland and holland and lamont dozier too
are here to make it all okay with you

one dark night he came home from the sea
and put a hole in her body where no hole should be
it hurt her more to see him walking out the door
and though they stitched her back together they left her heart in pieces on the floor

when the world falls apart some things stay in place
she takes off the four tops tape and puts it back in its case
when the world falls apart some things stay in place

i was beautiful then
i remember the time i knew what happiness was

seems to beat a fatalistic warning
someone mutters
and the streetlamp gutters
and soon it will be morning 

daylight
i must wait for the sunrise
i must think of a new life
and i mustn't give in
when the dawn comes
tonight will be a memory too
and a new day will begin 

burnt out ends of smoky days
the stale cold smell of morning
the streetlamp dies, another night is over
another day is dawning

of my days in the sun

you'll understand what happiness is

i found some love and i found some money 
found that blood would drip from the honey 
found i had a thirst that i could not quell 
lookin' for the water from a deeper well 

well...lookin for the water from a deeper well 
well...lookin for the water from a deeper well 

well i did it for kicks and i did it for faith 
i did it for lust and i did it for hate 
i did it for need and i did it for love 
addiction stayed on tight like a glove 
so i ran with the moon and i ran with the night 
and the three of us were a terrible sight 
nipple to the bottle to the gun to the cell 
to the bottom of a hole of a deeper well 

well...lookin for the water from a deeper well 
well...lookin for the water from a deeper well 

i rocked with the cradle and i rolled with the rage 
i shook those walls and i rattled that gage 
i took my trouble down a deadend trail 
reachin' out a hand for a holier grail 
hey there mama did you carry that load 
did you tell your baby 'bout the bend in the road 
'bout the rebel yell 'bout the one that fell 
lookin' for the water from a deeper well 

well...lookin for the water from a deeper well 
well...lookin for the water from a deeper well

1060,circle game,joni mitchell,Folk,"yesterday a child came out to wonder
caught a dragonfly inside a jar
fearful when the sky was full of thunder
and tearful at the falling of a star
then the child moved ten times round the seasons
skated over ten clear frozen streams
words like, when you're older, must appease him
and promises of someday make his dreams
and the seasons they go round and round
and the painted ponies go up and down
we're captive on the carousel of time
we can't return we can only look behind
from where we came
and go round and round and round
in the circle game.
sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town
and they tell him,
take your time, it won't be long now
till you drag your feet to slow the circles down
and the seasons they go round and round
and the painted ponies go up and down
we're captive on the carousel of time
we can't return we can only look behind
from where we came
and go round and round and round
in the circle game
so the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
though his dreams have lost some grandeur
coming true
there'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty
before the last revolving year is through.
and the seasons they go round and round
and the painted ponies go up and down
we're captive on the carousel of time
we can't return, we can only look behind
from where we came

1062,gentle on my mind,bobbie gentry,Folk,"it's knowin' that your door is always open
and your path is free to walk
that makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag
rolled up and stashed behind your couch
and it's knowin' i'm not shackled
by forgotten words and bonds
and the ink stains that have dried upon some line
that keeps you in the back roads
by the rivers of my memory
that keeps you ever gentle on my mind

it's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
planted on their columns now that bind me
or something that somebody said because
they thought we fit together walkin'
it's just knowing that the world
will not be cursing or forgiving
when i walk along some railroad track and find
that you're movin' on the back roads
by the rivers of my memory
and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
and the junkyards and the highways come between us
and some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'cause she turned and i was gone
i still might run in silence
tears of joy might stain my face
and the summer sun might burn me till i'm blind
but not to where i cannot see
you walkin' on the back roads
by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

i dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
in some train yard
my beard a rustlin' coal pile
and a dirty hat pulled low across my face
through cupped hands 'round a tin can
i pretend to hold you to my breast and find
that you're waitin' from the back roads
by the rivers of my memory
ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind"
1063,iowa,dar williams,Folk,"the summer ends and we wonder where we are 
and there you go, my friends, with your boxes in your car 
and you both look so young 
and last night was hard, you said 
you packed up every room 
and then you cried and went to bed 
but today you closed the door and said 
""we have to get a move on. 
it's just that time of year when we push ourselves ahead, 
we push ourselves ahead."" 

and it was cloudy in the morning 
and it rained as you drove away 
and the same things looked different 
it's the end of the summer 
it's the end of the summer, 
when you move to another place 

and i feel like the neighbor's girl who will never be the same 
she walked alone all spring, 
she had a boyfriend when the summer came 
and he gave her flowers in a lightning storm 
they disappeared at night in green fields of silver corn 
and sometime in july she just forgot that he was leaving 
so when the fields were dying, she held on to his sleeves 
she held on to his sleeves 

and she doesn't want to let go 
'cause she won't know what she's up against 
the classrooms and the smart girls 
it's the end of the summer 
it's the end of the summer 
when you hang your flowers up to dry 

and i had a dream it blows the autumn through my head 
it felt like the first day of school 
but i was going to the moon instead 
and i walked down the hall 
with the notebooks they got for me 
my dad led me through the house 
my mom drank instant coffee 
and i knew that i would crash 
but i didn't want to tell them 
there are just some moments when your family makes sense 
they just make sense 

so i raised up my arms and my mother put the sweater on 
we walked out on the dark and frozen grass 
the end of the summer 
it's the end of the summer 
when you send your children to the moon 

the summer ends and we wonder who we are 
and there you go, my friends, with your boxes in your car 
and today i passed the high school, the river, the maple tree 
i passed the farms that made it 
through the last days of the century 
and i knew that i was going to learn again 
again, in this less hazy light 
i saw the fields beyond the fields 
the fields beyond the fields 

and the colors are much brighter now 
it's like they really want to tell the truth 
we give our testimony to the end of the summer 
it's the end of the summer, 
you can spin the light to gold."

 she's my darling little precious baby girl
 like an angel to me and i know that he
 sent from heaven my little baby girl
she's as sweet as the flowers of springtime
her blue eyes they sparkle so bright
just a touch of her little baby hand

as dream of her i'm never all alone"
1067,when princes meet,anne hills,Folk,"when princes meet
the poor little men must tremble
in judgment seat

they speak of their wars
while great armies assemble
their armor shines
to shame the sun

they move like gods
they do resemble
all bow their necks
to iron feet when princes meet

when castles rise
the poor little men must build them
to charm the skies

they throw up the turrets
where the great lords will them
they dig the dungeons
from the earth

and their brothers
wives and children fill them
all those below cast down
their eyes when castles rise

god save the king
for he grants us leave to serve him
his praises sing
and grant that we may deserve him

who counts the cost?
the cattle and men to be lost?
'tis no small thing to serve a king

when kings make war
the poor little men must fight them
they must do more

they hold out their necks
for great lord's swords to bite them
the sons of the lords cleave
through their ranks

in the hopes some warrior king
might knight them
it's what the poor little men are for
when kings make war

hide your cattle in the woods, francois
the lord is looking your way
hide your women and your goods, francois
they're coming around to make you pay

hide if you can, poor little man
think of a prayer to say
hide if you can, poor little man
think of a prayer to say

god save the king
for he grants us leave to serve him
his praises sing
and grant that we may deserve him

who counts the cost?
the cattle and men to be lost?
'tis no small thing to serve a king

1070,talkin' cavan,tim o'brien,Folk,"a while ago i chanced to roam to the place my great grandad called home
it wasn't that much i saw that day, but i learned i whole lot along the way
i was goin' to ireland retracing my family footsteps diggin' up roots
you could call 'em tubers

the closer to the root of my family tree, the more people seemed to look like me
saw a sign said mollie o'brien's bar, i knew right then i couldn't be that far
i went in there and asked for beer, he pours this black stuff, he says, 'cheers'
'guinness gives you strength', he said, i'll tell you friends it's like drinkin' bread
there's a loaf in every pint i was feelin' strong felt like i wanted to sing

my whistle was wet and my tongue was loose
when the barman asked how come i'd choose
to travel such a long, long way on such a cold and rainy day
i said, 'i'm goin' up to kingscourt town. that's in county cavan, to look around.
my great grandaddy came from there.
i want to see if the old home place is still there.'
well he shook his head up and down
and then side to side and then he turned around and said
'a cavan man then you know, a lot of people wouldn't admit to that'

i figured i'd save a little hassle so i booked a room nearby in a fancy castle
had a hard time gettin' my dinner there
it was full of these people with light blonde hair
danish tourists two big busloads of 'em
now the owner of the place, his hair was black
when i talked to him, i didn't get much back
his people are what you call 'west brits'
they're the ones that treated my people like dirt
that's what lead to the irish civil war, i didn't know i'd come back for a little bit more
his nose was way up in the air but he took my money all the same

that night i dreamed i saw the ghost of the one i'd rather have as host
it was tom o'brien walkin' round the cabin, there in kingscourt town in county cavan
then the very next day in the hardware store
i found a cousin ten times removed or more
but he was no apparition, he wasn't a haint he was sellin' nuts and bolts and paint
i told him about our family connection, and he kinda stood there still, reflectin'
i could tell he wasn't that much impressed when he asked me with nary a trace of jest
he said, 'how exactly may i help you sir?'
i just bought some nails and got the hell out of there

then later that day after some detection, i found the lane in the rural section
it matched the picture in my dad's scrap book
and my heart beat faster as i drove to look
the sun burst through the clouds just then as i gazed at the current residents
it was a little sheep dog and an old milk cow
yeah the old home place is an old barn now
it's ashes to ashes dust to dust thatched roof to tin roof and tin roof to rust"
1071,the carnival is over,dead can dance,Folk,"outside
the storm clouds gathering,
moved silently along the dusty boulevard.
where flowers turning crane their fragile necks
so they can in turn
reach up and kiss the sky.

they are driven by a strange desire
unseen by the human eye
someone is calling.

i remember when you held my hand
in the park we would play when the circus came to town.
look! over here.

outside
the circus gathering
moved silently along the rainswept boulevard.
the procession moved on the shouting is over
the fabulous freaks are leaving town.

they are driven by a strange desire
unseen by the human eye.
the carnival is over

we sat and watched
as the moon rose again
for the very first time.

1072,little sadie,doc watson,Folk,"went out one night for to make a little round
i met little sadie and i shot her down
went back home and i got in my bed
forty four pistol under my head

wake up next morning 'bout a half past nine
the hacks and the buggies all standing in line
gents and the gamblers standing all round
taking little sadie to her burying ground

then i begin to think what a deed i'd done
i grabbed my hat and away i run
made a good run but a little too slow
they overtook me in jericho

i was standing on the corner, reading the bill
when up stepped the sheriff from thomasville
he said, young man, ain't your name brown?
remember the night you shot sadie down?

i said, yes, sir, my name is lee
i murdered little sadie in the first degree
and first degree and the second degree
if you got any papers, won't you read 'em to me?

they took me downtown and dressed me in black
put me on the train and started me back
they crammed me back in that thomasville jail
and i had no money for to go my bail

that judge and the jury, they took their stand
the judge had the papers in his right hand
forty one days and forty one nights
forty one years to wear the ball and the stripes

there was never any warning
there was never any sign
it's just that i woke up this morning
and eternity was mine

search my family history
analyze my dreams
expose my contradictions
reduce me to the mean
what you find might be revealing
it might very well be true
but you don't know what you're dealing with
you haven't got a clue

there was never any warning
there was never any sign

god knows i don't deserve this
after all the pain i've caused
but do me one last service
before i take that walk
before my soul flies from this chamber
and heaven beckons me across
read me what the saviour said
to that thief upon the cross

junked the juice, drink coffee instead
straightened my teeth, bent my back

she showed me the way to make her feel good
if i could do more then i surely would
for mary

for mary
for the sake of mary i do what i can
she still don't trust me to be her man
i say the right thing but my timing's bad
she thinks i'm like the rest, but i'm the best she's ever had

for the sake of mary
i was cook first class on the belfast be	
but when she sailed she sailed without me
in needle pete's got my last tattoo
in bleeding letters of red and blue

for mary
for the sake of mary i changed my drift
got a good job on the graveyard shift
she set her heart on a pretty little place
i want to see the tears of joy on her face

she's had her bad times and it's shook her about
i don't want to take the easy way out

leaving six white vapor trails across the bleak
terrain
it was the hexagram of the heavens
it was the strings of my guitar

the drone of flying engines
is a song so wild and blue
it scrambles time and seasons if it gets thru to you
then your life becomes a travelogue
of picture-post-card-charms

they'll tell you where to go

where some have found their paradise
others just come to harm

i wish that he was here tonight
it's so hard to obey
his sad request of me to kindly stay away
so this is how i hide the hurt
as the road leads cursed and charmed
i tell amelia, it was just a false alarm
a ghost of aviation
she was swallowed by the sky
or by the sea, like me she had a dream to fly
like icarus ascending
on beautiful foolish arms

maybe i've never really loved
i guess that is the truth
i've spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitude
and looking down on everything
i crashed into his arms

back there on the mucky side

put the business in the black
and they've stabbed us in the back
with old school ties and little white lies
they left our town for scrap

golden handshake, sling our hooks
now we're nursemaids, now we're cooks
now our kids steal pension books
last shift, close her down

now the scrapper boys infest
and the wrecking balls caress
like vermin round a burial ground
they catch the smell of death

and we're beggars on the dole

when we first met i played the shy boy
and when she spoke to me for the first time
my nose began to bleed
she guessed the rest

the next day we went on a bus ride to the ferry
and when nobody came to collect our fares
well, i knew then this was something special
i couldn't stop thinking about her
and every time i switched on the radio
there was somebody else singing a song about the two of us

it was just like being on a fast ride at the funfair
the sort you wanna get off because it?s scary
and then as soon as you?re off
you wanna get straight back on again

but our love is strange
and you have to take the crunchy with the smooth i s'pose
she began going out with mr potato head
it was when i saw her in the car park
with his coat around her shoulders that i realized
i went home and thought about the two of them together
until the bath water went cold around me

i thought about her eyes and the curve of her breasts
and about the point where their bodies met
i confronted her about it.
i said, ""i?m the most illegible bachelor in town.""
and she said, ""yea, that's why i can never understand
any of those silly letters you send me.""

they were given books to poison their minds.
the river is deep and the mountain high,
how long before the other side. 
we are their mortar,
their building bricks and their clay.
their gold teeth mirror
both our joys and our pain.
the river is deep and the ocean wide,
who will teach us how to read the signs. 
the earth is our mother
she taught us to embrace the light,
now the lord is master
she suffers an eternal night.

you plucked out my eyes,
you cut out my tongue,
you fed me with lies,

where my youth was gallantly led
and where the sun took a holiday
fell in love, decided to stay

i'm so tired and down
down, down, down, down
down, down, down, down
down, down, down, down

could you be where my best friend plays
where the nights bleed longer then the days
where i lost my only child
where the're no trees but wolves run wild

maybe somewhere i've never seen
tangier's or the banks of berlin
strangers they can veil a friendly eye
rather be with you than a lie

i'm so tired and down
down, down, down, down
down, down, down, down
down, down, down, down

could you be where my angel sleeps
when he sings willows begin to weep
when i think of all i have done

home, is where my heart is
home, is where my heart is

1100,she rises like the dolphin,kate wolf,Folk,"she rises like the dolphin, with the sea wind in her eyes. 
the sunlight casting shadows, like a painter's palette knife
her hair fans out around her, floating like a crown.
she plays on the water, lets it pull her down.

sometimes she swims in moonlight with the stars high above. 
the night sounds of the water speaking soft of love.
her skin turns to velvet as she feels the waters glide. 
she loses all her boundaries on this magic carpet ride.

you see ripples on the water and watch the shadows dance. 
then she's diving down and you're looking through a glass. 
like a one way mirror, her reflection's far below. 
where she was, she isn't now.
that's all you really know.

two swimmers in the water, one of silver, one of gold. 
one below the surface, one reaching for a hold. 
one floating freely, one tryin' not to drown. 
a dreamer with two faces, a dolphin and a clown.

if you think you'll hold her in a shallow pool, 
catch her in a waterfall, you're thinking like a fool.
she'll strike up the horizon, like a ship out to sea.
leaving just illusions that look like memories.

she wears the water like a mask, a brand new suit of clothes.
a player on the stage, an actress no one knows. see her roll and tumble, 
falling like a clown. 
a swimmer in the water that flies to higher ground"

when you're this weak
and this spacey...

1105,jealous moon,hayes carll,Folk,"the moon is slowly rising
it's really not surprising
after all, she's there most every night
smiling on the lovers
always shining on the others
and bathing in the sun's reflected light

but later on she's fade away
hidden by the break of day
that always comes too soon
poor little thing
she's just a jealous moon

she plays above the water
watching sailors, tramps and daughters
live their lives and slowly fade away
night afternight, year after year
once she knows she'll disappear
into a world she never gets to stay

but she would give most anything
to open up her heart and sing
but no one hears her tune
poor little thing
she's just a jealous moon

no one ask her how she got so high
way up there forever in the lonely sky

she watches through the seasons
hoping without reason
that someday someone will call her home
but life goes on without her
no one ever ask about her
or lets her know that she's not alone

it breaks her heart that down below
rivers run, flowers grow
but she can't feel them bloom
poor little thing
she's just a jealous moon

the nights are getting colder
stars are growing bolder
as they paint their final light across the sky
but closer to the atmosphere
she prays for clouds to disappear
so she could say goodnight and say goodbye

she never really goes away
just hidden by another day
that always comes too soon
poor little thing
she's just a jealous moon
poor little thing
she's just a jealous moon"

go down that worn out place again

i wrapped your love around me like a chain
but i never was afraid that it would die
you can dance in a hurricane
but only if you're standing in the eye

where did you learn to walk?
where did you learn to run?
away from everything you love
and did you think the bottle
would ever ease your pain?
did you think that love's a foolish game?
did you find someone else to take the blame?

i wrapped your love around me like a chain
but i never was afraid that it would die
you can dance in a hurricane
but only if you're standing in the eye

you can dance in a hurricane
but only if you're standing in the eye

i am a sturdy soul
and there ain't no shame
in lying down in the bed you made
can you fight the urge to run for another day?
you might make it further if you learn to stay

1120,big italian rose,fred small,Folk,"she was riding on the airline leafing through their magazine
they said, ""we'll fly you to the homeland that you have never seen""
smiling tourists in the picture back in sunny italy
said she, ""these pretty people don't look anything like me""

[chorus]
i'm a big italian woman and i want the world to see
all the big italian women who look just like me
you can take your slender models and their fifth avenue clothes
but you'll never find a flower like the big italian rose

well, the more she thought about it, the more it made her mad
how they make you feel so ugly, how they make you feel so bad
sell you junk food and booze then make you diet till you're dead
she sat and wrote a letter and this is what it said:

[chorus]

""well, i'm nearly 57, my hair is turning gray
the dress i wore at 20 i cannot wear today
just an ordinary woman and it sure would make me glad
just for once to see someone like me in your ad""

[chorus]

three weeks later came an answer, from new york it was sent
said ""we'd like to take your picture for our next advertisement""
soon magazines across the nation in a prominent place
showed a big italian woman with a smile on her face

in your voice there was something wrong

as we have shared so many tears
with fervor our dreams we planned a whole life long
now are scattered on the wind...
chorus
in the terms of endearment
in the terms of the life that you love
in the terms of the years that pass you by
in the terms of the reasons why
through the years i've grown to love you
though your commitment to most would offend
but i stuck by you holding on with my foolish pride
waiting for you to give in...
you never really tried or so it seems
i've had more than myself to blame
i've had enough of trying everything
and this time it is the end...
chorus
there's no more coming back this way
the path is overgrown and strewn with thorns
they've torn the life-blood from your naked eyes
cast aside to be forlorn...

seemed to make no difference to you at all..."

1124,life is bad,shelby lynne,Folk,"waste away to nothin' in a dark dusty tomb
lookin' for the traces of what used to be a room
wipe away the blood from a tormented brow
solve the wicked problem never asking how

rock the sinking vessel till it rests on the bottom
count the waves of water don't remember forgot them
taste the stench of livin' on thin dimes and a dream
opening an ear to a painful silent scream

oh life is bad
oh no, worst i ever had

ache and writhe in agony like a vise on aging bones
tar and acid drip from an ice cram cone
holding onto a wind that chases the hell
fallin' in the darkness of an inner descending well

caress transparent night as a demon with a sword
speak with an eloquence never saying a word
look into the clarity then erase it with the muck
lying in a pool of consciousness no such thing as luck

to being a beginner, to inventing the end
to livin' with a strangler never a friend
saddle slobbering beast trouble is abound
ride the devil's bronco never hit the ground"

i stay untold by the truth
i'm sold by a lie

splintered under our skin

until you cry, ""now you must try my greed""
and everything depends upon
how near you sleep to me

all the lonely things my hands have done
let me see your beauty broken down
like you would do for one your love

hungry as an archway
through which the troops have passed
i stand in ruins behind you
with your winter clothes, your broken sandal straps
i love to see you naked over there
especially from the back

oh, take this longing from my tongue
all the useless things my hands have done
untie for me your hired blue gown
like you would do for one that you love

you're faithful to the better man
i'm afraid that he left
so let me judge your love affair
in this very room where i have sentenced mine to death
i'll even wear these old laurel leaves
that he's shaken from his head

and the laughing harmonies
songs to aging children come
aging children, i am one
some come dark and strange like dying
crows and ravens whistling
lines of weeping, strings of crying
so much said in listening
songs to aging children come
aging children, i am one
does the moon play only silver
when it strums the galaxy
dying roses will they will their
perfumed rhapsodies to me
songs to aging children came
this is one."

standing together by the sea
light on the water so beautiful in the dawn
i am looking into your eyes
before the secrets, before the lies,
your lips are smiling as though you meant to go on.

i don't remember the words
that you said to me
i don't remember the words
but the melody 
haunts me

i found a rose that you gave to me
pressed in a book of your poetry
deathless prose like the love i thought that we shared
you left my life with no backward look
i crushed the rose and i burned the book
i cursed the day that i ever thought you could care

i don't remember the words
that you said to me
i don't remember the words
but the melody
haunts me

melody, melody, melody
melody, melody, melody

there's not a day i don't think of you
there's not a think that i know to do
to keep your memory from invading my heart
and though your flowers and books are gone
the melody of you lingers on
you are a part of my song so what can i do

i don't remember the words
that you said to me
i don't remember the words
but the melody 
haunts me

there were women there as well,
with babies in their arms, before my eyes.

she makes the most of her time by loving me plenty
she knows there'll come a day when we won't be getting any

the stain of the sepia the butcher crimea
through the wreck of a brass band i thought i could see her
in a cakewalk she came through the dead and the lame
just a little bird floating on a hurricane

i was flat on my back with my feet in the thorns
i was in between the apples and the chloroform
she came to me often
i was sure i was dying
it was always hard to tell if she was laughing or crying

i thought i heard somebody calling
in the dark i thought i heard somebody call

joan never cared about the in-betweens
combed her hair with a blade did the maid of orleans
said christ walked on water we can wade through the war
you don't need to tell me who the fire is for

oh bring me the love that can sweeten a sword
a boat that can love the rocks or the shore
the love of the iceberg reaching out for a wreck
can you love me like the crosses love the nape of the neck?

was it casey jones or casey at the bat
who died out of pride and got famous for that
killed by a swerve laid low by the curve
do you ever think they ever thought they got what they deserved

pity the bullet and pity the man
who both find their place in the same sad plan
who both are like the barrel going over the falls
crying all the way down i never asked to be involved

i thought i heard somebody calling in the dark i thought i heard somebody call

sent his men to the top of some hell of a hill
through the whisper of trees came artillery breeze

lemonade on your breath sun in your hair
did i mention how i love you in your underwear?

and then i confess that i tortured the dress that you wore for the world to look through

i showed my heart to the doctor. he said i'd just have to quit
then he wrote himself a prescription, your name was mentioned in it 
then he locked himself in a library shelf with the details of our honeymoon
and i hear from the nurse that he's gotten much worse and his practice is all in a ruin

i heard of a saint who had loved you, i studied all night in his school 
he taught that the duty of lovers is to tarnish the golden rule 
and just when i was sure that his teachings were pure he drowned himself in the pool
his body is gone but back here on the lawn his spirit continues to drool

an eskimo showed me a movie he'd recently taken of you 
the poor man could hardly stop shivering, his lips and his fingers were blue
i suppose that he froze when the wind tore off your clothes 
and i guess he just never got warm, but you stand there so nice in your blizzard of ice

when she spoke to me for the first time my nose began to bleed
she guessed the rest
the next day we went on a bus ride to the ferry
and when nobody came to collect our fares
well
i knew then this was something special
i couldn't stop thinking about her
and every time i switched on the radio
there was somebody else singing a song about the two of us
it was just like being on a fast ride at the fun fair
the sort you want to get off because its scary
and then as soon as you're off you want get straight back on again
but all love is strange
and you have to learn to take the crunchy with the smooth i suppose
she began going out with mr. potato head
it was when i saw her in he car park
with his coat around her shoulders that i realized
i went home and thought about the two of them together
until the bathwater went cold around me
i thought about her eyes and the curve of her breasts
and about the point where their bodies met
i confronted her about it
i said
""i'm the most illegible bachelor in town""
and she said
""yeah. that's why i can never understand any of those silly letters you send me""
and then one day it happened
she cut her hair and i stopped loving her"

she got a hundred black horses with sulphur and coal on their breath
and she rides the unbelievers down, mother knows best
she says ""bring me your first-born, and i'll suck their blood
bring me your poor, i can trample in the mud
bring me your visionaries, i can put out their eyes
and bring me your scholars, i'll have them all lobotomised,
'cause mother knows best"
1190,lazy days,leona naess,Folk,"why can't you be with me?
watching american tv
we'll order in chinese
and ask the world to stay away, please

these hotels grow so stale
telling the same ass-tale
by the time i get to you
i'll be too tired to...

[chorus]
soak up some lazy days
no one can rain on our parade
standing here beneath the shade
of our love

let's slide down the avenue
like good new yorkers do
maybe then i'll believe 
when you give, man, you receive

[chorus]

wide-eyed and stupid 
i'm waiting for the arrows of cupid
wide-eyed and stupid
i'm waiting for the arrows of cupid
wide-eyed and stupid
i'm waiting for the arrows 
of your love"
1191,if i wrote you,joan baez,Folk,"i never thought you were the letter writing type
so now i see the words you chose the way you write
so i started to write back about the trees in the snow
and i saw a bird, couldn't see what it was but i thought you'd know
you always surprised me

and if i wrote you
if i wrote you
you would know me
and you would not write me again

and when the spring came and flooded all the streams
it's like how you got the night you told me all you dreams
and when the barn roof sagged after an icy bout
it's like how you got when you knew the truth was the only way out
but not the only way

and if i wrote you
if i wrote you
you would know me
and you would not write me again

we drew our arms around the bastard sons
we never would drink to the chosen ones
well you know the way i left was not the way i planned
but i thought the world needed love and a steady hand
so i'm steady now

and i'm so happy
i had to tell you
and i love you
and you will not write me again
you will not write me again
you will not write me again"
1192,"i wish i may, i wish i might",carrie newcomer,Folk,"sweet corn days in oakland city 
the apple fest in nappanee 
the blueberry cavalcade 
the sacred heart polish days 
oktoberfest in rensselaer 
marshmallow days in ligonier 
the feast of the hunter's moon 
the pork and pumpkin rendezvous 

at this year's county fair 
all our friends will be there 
gather kin and cousins near 
and everything we love is here 

soybean fest in rising sun 
scarecrow days in wanatah 
the bean blossom jamboree 
maple syrup fest in wawasee 
popcorn fair in versailles 
the mennonite relief quilt sale 
a fish fry, gala, holiday 
covered bridge and dogwood days 

there'll be fireworks and lemonade 
a tractor pull and fine parade 
there'll be a gospel jubilee 
right before they crown the sausage queen 

bingo games and polka bands 
arts and crafts made by hand 
pierogies, sweet corn on a stick 
carnival rides think of it 
now i am grown and miles away 
from apple nights and limestone days 
i wish i may i wish i might 
be at the county fair tonight"
1193,dark time,october project,Folk,"what dark time is coming, what dark time is here 
the prophet emerges in garments of fear 
he calls to his people to come to the feast 
they gather unto him to wait for release 
alleluia 
remember the warnings, forget what you're told 
the heart of the temple is hollow and cold 
the face of the prophet is tired and creased 
he raises his cup and falls to his knees 

come take my body, come take my soul 
come take me over, i want to be whole 
come take my body, come take my soul 

we stand in a circle, we stand in the square 
the power of numbers, the power of prayer 
the churches are empty, the priest has gone home 
and we are left standing, together alone 

come take my body, come take my soul 
come take me over, i want to be whole 
come take my body, come take my soul 

come rhythm, come silence, come into our shame 
the fear has no heart and the fear has no name 
come sing alleluia, come sing domine 
come sing alleluia, come sing 

come take my body, come take my soul 
come take me over, i want to be whole 
come take my body, come take my soul

1194,more pretty girls than one,lester flatt,Folk,"there's more pretty girls than one
more pretty girls then one
every old town that i rambled around
and there's more pretty girls than one

mama talked to me last night
she gave me some good advise
she said ""son, you'd better quit this old ramblin' all around
and mary you a sweet little wife""

(break)

honey, look down that old lonesome road
hang down your pretty head and cry
'cause i'm thinking all about them pretty little gals
and a-hopin' that i never die

there's more pretty girls than one
there's more pretty girls then one
every old town that i rambled around
and there's more pretty girls than one

1195,when i take my vacation in heaven,the blue sky boys,Folk,"there are those who are taking vacations to the mountains the lakes and the sea 
where they rest from their cares and their troubles 
what a wonderful time that must be 
but it seems not my lot to be like them i must toil through the heat and the cold 
seekin' out the lost sheep on the mountains bringing wanderers back to the fold 
but when i take my vacation in heaven what a wonderful time that will be 
hearing concerts by the heavenly chorus and the face of my saviour i'll see 
sitting down on the banks of the river neath the shade of the evergreen tree 
there i'll rest from my burdens forever won't you take your vacation with me 
(sitting down on the banks of the river under the shade of the evergreen tree) 
there i'll rest from my burdens forever won't you take your vacation with me"
1196,the myth of trust,billy bragg,Folk,"i woke up this morning
to find that we have outlived the myth of trust
you woke up this morning
to the fact we've lost the things
we took for granted between us
and i grew up in awe of the girl next door
and the boy that never cried

and i was dreaming of those elizabethan girls
while you were working in the market
to earn ourselves

and when you found out what happened yesterday
while you were away in this land of cain
we were upstairs in the bedroom
dancing disgusting

and flushing our babies down the drain
and the apple that don't want to get eaten
will still fall off the tree

when you're in as deep as we are honey
it's so easy to get washed out to sea
for the facts of life are not man and wife
but man and woman sadly

and the apple that don't want to get eaten
will still fall off the tree

i woke up this morning
to find that we have outlived the myth of trust"
1197,old-dreams-and-new-hopes,bill-miller,Folk,"old pictures kept in a tattered cardboard box
and after church on sunday it was a crazy thing to watch
how we'd gather 'round the table like pieces of a puzzle that didn't fit
i don't believe there was one memory that my momma could not relive
she has old dreams and new hopes
worn out quilts and jump ropes from days gone by
she has old dreams and new hopes
cold hands, warm heart and a faith that just won't die
when everyone had gone to bed, my dad was in the kitchen eatin' pie
he's listening to his radio, i don't believe i ever saw my daddy cry
put behind his days of drinkin', but i do believe that the bottle took its toll
now he needs his nights for thinkin' cause his heart just can't admit he's growing old
he has old dreams and new hopes
worn out books and a pack of smokes to get him by
he has old dreams and new hopes
good jokes, strong coffee and a heart that just won't die
i can see him in the kitchen fast asleep with the morning coming on
and my momma's sleeping peacfully with her crucifix and her pictures all around
she'll be up before he notices making eggs and bacon for his day
he'll warm up his cup of coffee, get a hug and be on his way
they have old dreams and new hopes
nine children and a house in the woods to get them by
they have old dreams and new hopes
faced the hard times together with a love that just won't die
no, it just won't die
just won't die"
1198,carey,joni mitchell,Folk,"the wind is in from africa
last night i couldn't sleep
oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here carey
but it's really not my home
my fingernails are filthy, i got beach tar on my feet
and i miss my clean white linen and my fancy french cologne
oh carey get out your cane
and i'll put on some silver
oh you're a mean old daddy, but i like you fine
come on down to the mermaid cafe and i will buy you a bottle of wine
and we'll laugh and toast to nothing and smash our empty glasses down
let's have a round for these freaks and these soldiers
a round for these friends of mine
let's have another round for the bright red devil
who keeps me in this tourist town
come on, carey, get out your cane
i'll put on some silver
oh you're a mean old daddy, but i like you
maybe i'll go to amsterdam
or maybe i'll go to rome
and rent me a grand piano and put some flowers 'round my room
but let's not talk about fare-thee-welis now
the night is a starry dome.
and they're playin' that scratchy rock and roll
beneath the matalla moon
come on, carey, get out your cane
and i'll put on some silver
you're a mean old daddy, but i like you
the wind is in from africa
last night i couldn't sleep
oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here
but, it's really not my home
maybe it's been too long a time
since i was scramblin' down in the street
now they got me used to that clean white linen
and that fancy french cologne
oh carey, get out your cane
i'll put on my finest silver
we'll go to the mermaid cafe
have fun tonight
i said, oh, you're a mean old daddy, but you're out of sight."
1199,looking out,brandi carlile,Folk,"i went out looking for the answers and never left my town.

i'm no good at understanding, but i'm good at standing ground.
and when i asked a corner preacher i couldn't hear him for my youth. 
some people get religion some people get the truth. 
i never get the truth, i never get the truth.

i know the darkness falls on you. and it's just a point of view
when you're outside looking in you belong to someone and when
you feel like giving in and the coming of the end, like your
heart can break in two, someone loves you.

i lay this suitcase on my chest so i can feel somebody's weight.
and i lay you to rest just to feel a give and take?
i got a new interpretation and it's a better point of view, you
were looking for a landslide i was looking out for you, i was
looking out for you, someone's looking out for you

i know the darkness falls on you. 
and it's just a point of view
when you're outside looking in you belong to someone and when
you feel like giving in and the coming of the end, 
like your heart can break in two, someone loves you.

i am afraid of crossing lines. 
i am afraid of flying blind.
afraid of inquiring minds. 
afraid of being left behind.

i close my eyes i think of you, i take a step i think of you,
i catch my breath i think of you, i cannot rest i think of you

my one and only wrecking ball, and you're cutting through my walls. 
when you're outside looking in you belong to someone and
when you feel like giving in and the coming of the end, 
like your heart could break in two, someone loves you."
